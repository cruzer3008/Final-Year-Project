      "\n",
      "The object of a translator should ever be to hold the mirror upto his\n",
      "author. That being so, his chief duty is to represent so far as\n",
      "practicable the manner in which his author's ideas have been expressed,\n",
      "retaining if possible at the sacrifice of idiom and taste all the\n",
      "peculiarities of his author's imagery and of language as well. In regard\n",
      "to translations from the Sanskrit, nothing is easier than to dish up\n",
      "Hindu ideas, so as to make them agreeable to English taste. But the\n",
      "endeavour of the present translator has been to give in the following\n",
      "pages as literal a rendering as possible of the great work of Vyasa. To\n",
      "the purely English reader there is much in the following pages that will\n",
      "strike as ridiculous. Those unacquainted with any language but their own\n",
      "are generally very exclusive in matters of taste. Having no knowledge of\n",
      "models other than what they meet with in their own tongue, the standard\n",
      "they have formed of purity and taste in composition must necessarily be a\n",
      "narrow one. The translator, however, would ill-discharge his duty, if for\n",
      "the sake of avoiding ridicule, he sacrificed fidelity to the original. He\n",
      "must represent his author as he is, not as he should be to please the\n",
      "narrow taste of those entirely unacquainted with him. Mr. Pickford, in\n",
      "the preface to his English translation of the Mahavira Charita, ably\n",
      "defends a close adherence to the original even at the sacrifice of idiom\n",
      "and taste against the claims of what has been called 'Free Translation,'\n",
      "which means dressing the author in an outlandish garb to please those to\n",
      "whom he is introduced.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the preface to his classical translation of Bhartrihari's Niti Satakam\n",
      "and Vairagya Satakam, Mr. C.H. Tawney says, \"I am sensible that in the\n",
      "present attempt I have retained much local colouring. For instance, the\n",
      "ideas of worshipping the feet of a god of great men, though it frequently\n",
      "occurs in Indian literature, will undoubtedly move the laughter of\n",
      "Englishmen unacquainted with Sanskrit, especially if they happen to\n",
      "belong to that class of readers who revel their attention on the\n",
      "accidental and remain blind to the essential. But a certain measure of\n",
      "fidelity to the original even at the risk of making oneself ridiculous,\n",
      "is better than the studied dishonesty which characterises so many\n",
      "translations of oriental poets.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "We fully subscribe to the above although, it must be observed, the\n",
      "censure conveyed to the class of translators last indicated is rather\n",
      "undeserved, there being nothing like a 'studied dishonesty' in their\n",
      "efforts which proceed only from a mistaken view of their duties and as\n",
      "such betray only an error of the head but not of the heart. More than\n",
      "twelve years ago when Babu Pratapa Chandra Roy, with Babu Durga Charan\n",
      "Banerjee, went to my retreat at Seebpore, for engaging me to translate\n",
      "the Mahabharata into English, I was amazed with the grandeur of the\n",
      "scheme. My first question to him was,--whence was the money to come,\n",
      "supposing my competence for the task. Pratapa then unfolded to me the\n",
      "details of his plan, the hopes he could legitimately cherish of\n",
      "assistance from different quarters. He was full of enthusiasm. He showed\n",
      "me Dr. Rost's letter, which, he said, had suggested to him the\n",
      "undertaking. I had known Babu Durga Charan for many years and I had the\n",
      "highest opinion of his scholarship and practical good sense. When he\n",
      "warmly took Pratapa's side for convincing me of the practicability of the\n",
      "scheme, I listened to him patiently. The two were for completing all\n",
      "arrangements with me the very day. To this I did not agree. I took a\n",
      "week's time to consider. I consulted some of my literary friends,\n",
      "foremost among whom was the late lamented Dr. Sambhu C. Mookherjee. The\n",
      "latter, I found, had been waited upon by Pratapa. Dr. Mookherjee spoke to\n",
      "me of Pratapa as a man of indomitable energy and perseverance. The result\n",
      "of my conference with Dr. Mookherjee was that I wrote to Pratapa asking\n",
      "him to see me again. In this second interview estimates were drawn up,\n",
      "and everything was arranged as far as my portion of the work was\n",
      "concerned. My friend left with me a specimen of translation which he had\n",
      "received from Professor Max Muller. This I began to study, carefully\n",
      "comparing it sentence by sentence with the original. About its literal\n",
      "character there could be no doubt, but it had no flow and, therefore,\n",
      "could not be perused with pleasure by the general reader. The translation\n",
      "had been executed thirty years ago by a young German friend of the great\n",
      "Pundit. I had to touch up every sentence. This I did without at all\n",
      "impairing faithfulness to the original. My first 'copy' was set up in\n",
      "type and a dozen sheets were struck off. These were submitted to the\n",
      "judgment of a number of eminent writers, European and native. All of\n",
      "them, I was glad to see, approved of the specimen, and then the task of\n",
      "translating the Mahabharata into English seriously began.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before, however, the first fasciculus could be issued, the question as to\n",
      "whether the authorship of the translation should be publicly owned,\n",
      "arose. Babu Pratapa Chandra Roy was against anonymity. I was for it. The\n",
      "reasons I adduced were chiefly founded upon the impossibility of one\n",
      "person translating the whole of the gigantic work. Notwithstanding my\n",
      "resolve to discharge to the fullest extent the duty that I took up, I\n",
      "might not live to carry it out. It would take many years before the end\n",
      "could be reached. Other circumstances than death might arise in\n",
      "consequence of which my connection with the work might cease. It could\n",
      "not be desirable to issue successive fasciculus with the names of a\n",
      "succession of translators appearing on the title pages. These and other\n",
      "considerations convinced my friend that, after all, my view was correct.\n",
      "It was, accordingly, resolved to withhold the name of the translator. As\n",
      "a compromise, however, between the two views, it was resolved to issue\n",
      "the first fasciculus with two prefaces, one over the signature of the\n",
      "publisher and the other headed--'Translator's Preface.' This, it was\n",
      "supposed, would effectually guard against misconceptions of every kind.\n",
      "No careful reader would then confound the publisher with the author.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although this plan was adopted, yet before a fourth of the task had been\n",
      "accomplished, an influential Indian journal came down upon poor Pratapa\n",
      "Chandra Roy and accused him openly of being a party to a great literary\n",
      "imposture, viz., of posing before the world as the translator of Vyasa's\n",
      "work when, in fact, he was only the publisher. The charge came upon my\n",
      "friend as a surprise, especially as he had never made a secret of the\n",
      "authorship in his correspondence with Oriental scholars in every part of\n",
      "the world. He promptly wrote to the journal in question, explaining the\n",
      "reasons there were for anonymity, and pointing to the two prefaces with\n",
      "which the first fasciculus had been given to the world. The editor\n",
      "readily admitted his mistake and made a satisfactory apology.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now that the translation has been completed, there can no longer be any\n",
      "reason for withholding the name of the translator. The entire translation\n",
      "is practically the work of one hand. In portions of the Adi and the Sabha\n",
      "Parvas, I was assisted by Babu Charu Charan Mookerjee. About four forms\n",
      "of the Sabha Parva were done by Professor Krishna Kamal Bhattacharya, and\n",
      "about half a fasciculus during my illness, was done by another hand. I\n",
      "should however state that before passing to the printer the copy received\n",
      "from these gentlemen I carefully compared every sentence with the\n",
      "original, making such alterations as were needed for securing a\n",
      "uniformity of style with the rest of the work.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should here observe that in rendering the Mahabharata into English I\n",
      "have derived very little aid from the three Bengali versions that are\n",
      "supposed to have been executed with care. Every one of these is full of\n",
      "inaccuracies and blunders of every description. The Santi in particular\n",
      "which is by far the most difficult of the eighteen Parvas, has been made\n",
      "a mess of by the Pundits that attacked it. Hundreds of ridiculous\n",
      "blunders can be pointed out in both the Rajadharma and the Mokshadharma\n",
      "sections. Some of these I have pointed out in footnotes.\n",
      "\n",
      "I cannot lay claim to infallibility. There are verses in the Mahabharata\n",
      "that are exceedingly difficult to construe. I have derived much aid from\n",
      "the great commentator Nilakantha. I know that Nilakantha's authority is\n",
      "not incapable of being challenged. But when it is remembered that the\n",
      "interpretations given by Nilakantha came down to him from preceptors of\n",
      "olden days, one should think twice before rejecting Nilakantha as a guide.\n",
      "\n",
      "About the readings I have adopted, I should say that as regards the first\n",
      "half of the work, I have generally adhered to the Bengal texts; as\n",
      "regards the latter half, to the printed Bombay edition. Sometimes\n",
      "individual sections, as occurring in the Bengal editions, differ widely,\n",
      "in respect of the order of the verses, from the corresponding ones in the\n",
      "Bombay edition. In such cases I have adhered to the Bengal texts,\n",
      "convinced that the sequence of ideas has been better preserved in the\n",
      "Bengal editions than the Bombay one.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should express my particular obligations to Pundit Ram Nath Tarkaratna,\n",
      "the author of 'Vasudeva Vijayam' and other poems, Pundit Shyama Charan\n",
      "Kaviratna, the learned editor of Kavyaprakasha with the commentary of\n",
      "Professor Mahesh Chandra Nayaratna, and Babu Aghore Nath Banerjee, the\n",
      "manager of the Bharata Karyalaya. All these scholars were my referees on\n",
      "all points of difficulty. Pundit Ram Nath's solid scholarship is known to\n",
      "them that have come in contact with him. I never referred to him a\n",
      "difficulty that he could not clear up. Unfortunately, he was not always\n",
      "at hand to consult. Pundit Shyama Charan Kaviratna, during my residence\n",
      "at Seebpore, assisted me in going over the Mokshadharma sections of the\n",
      "Santi Parva. Unostentatious in the extreme, Kaviratna is truly the type\n",
      "of a learned Brahman of ancient India. Babu Aghore Nath Banerjee also has\n",

      "late lamented Dr. Reinhold Rost, and Mons. A. Barth of Paris. All these\n",

      "identify that infant with the youth before his eyes. The youth, however,\n",
      "seeing his father, knew him at once, but instead of disclosing himself,\n",
      "he clouded the king's perception by his celestial powers of illusion and\n",
      "disappeared in his very sight.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"King Santanu, wondering much at what he saw and imagining the youth to\n",

      "with ornaments in her right arm, showed him to Santanu. And Santanu did\n",
      "not recognise that beautiful female bedecked with ornaments and attired\n",
      "in fine robes of white, although he had known her before. And Ganga said,\n",
      "'O tiger among men, that eighth son whom thou hadst some time before\n",

      "all weapons, O monarch, take him now. I have reared him with care. And go\n",
      "home, O tiger among men, taking him with thee. Endued with superior\n",
      "intelligence, he has studied with Vasishtha the entire Vedas with their\n",
      "branches. Skilled in all weapons and a mighty bowman, he is like Indra in\n",
      "battle. And, O Bharata, both the gods and the Asuras look upon him with\n",
      "favour. Whatever branches of knowledge are known to Usanas, this one\n",

      "his child resembling the Sun himself in glory and returned to his\n",
      "capital. And having reached his city that was like unto the celestial\n",
      "capital, that monarch of Puru's line regarded himself greatly fortunate.\n",

      "not entertain a shadow of doubt that one attains to heaven in consequence\n",
      "of his having begotten a son. The Vedas which constitute the root of the\n",

      "in the company of four friends, viz., a tiger, a mouse, a wolf, and a\n",
      "mongoose. One day they saw in the woods a strong deer, the leader of a\n",
      "herd, whom, however, they could not seize for his fleetness and strength.\n",
      "They thereupon called a council for consultation. The jackal opening the\n",
      "proceedings said, 'O tiger, thou hast made many an effort to seize this\n",

      "asleep. And when this is done, let the tiger approach and seize it. Then\n",
      "shall we all, with great pleasure feast on it.' Hearing these words of\n",
      "the jackal, they all set to work very cautiously as he directed. And the\n",
      "mouse ate into the feet of the deer and the tiger killed it as\n",
      "anticipated. And beholding the body of the deer lying motionless on the\n",
      "ground, the jackal said unto his companions, 'Blessed be ye! Go and\n",
      "perform your ablutions. In the meantime I will look after the deer.'\n",
      "Hearing what the jackal said, they all went into a stream. And the jackal\n",

      "with great strength, returned first of all to the spot after having\n",
      "performed his ablutions. And he saw the jackal there plunged in\n",

      "art the foremost of all intelligent beings. Let us enjoy ourselves today\n",
      "by feasting on this carcass.' The jackal said, 'Hear, O mighty-armed one,\n",
      "what the mouse hath said. He hath even said, O, fie on the strength of\n",
      "the king of the beasts! This deer hath been slain by me. By might of my\n",
      "arm he will today gratify his hunger.' When he hath boasted in such a\n",
      "language, I, for my part, do not wish to touch this food.' The tiger\n",
      "replied, 'If, indeed, the mouse hath said so, my sense is now awakened. I\n",
      "shall, from this day, slay with the might of my own arms, creatures\n",

      "any weapon. It was the chief of all weapons, and the grinder of them all.\n",
      "And it was the smiter of hostile armies and was alone equal to a hundred\n",

      "assist at the task. And Pavaka then gave unto Krishna a discus with an\n",
      "iron pole attached to a hole in the centre. And it was a fiery weapon and\n",
      "became his favourite. Having obtained that weapon, Krishna also became\n",
      "equal to the task. Pavaka then, addressing Krishna, said, 'With this, O\n",
      "slayer of Madhu, thou shalt be able without doubt to vanquish in battle\n",
      "even foes that are not human. With this weapon, without doubt, thou shalt\n",
      "be superior in battle to men and gods, and Rakshasas and Pisachas, and\n",
      "Daityas and Nagas. And thou shalt certainly be able with this to smite\n",

      "will irresistibly slay the enemy and again come back into thy hands.' And\n",
