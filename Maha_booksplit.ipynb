      "standard and umbrella and bow on earth.[27] Then piercing Paurava with\n",
      "seven arrows, Subhadra's son pierced the latter's driver and steeds with\n",
      "five arrows. Gladdening his troops thus, he then repeatedly roared like a\n",

      "certain to take away Paurava's life. Beholding however, that arrow of\n",
      "frightful mien fixed on Abhimanyu's bow-string, Haridika's son, with two\n",
      "shafts, cut off that bow and arrow. Then that slayer of hostile heroes,\n",
      "viz., Subhadra's son, throwing aside that broken bow, took up a bright\n",
      "sword and a shield. Whirling with great speed that shield decked with\n",
      "many stars, and whirling that sword also, he coursed on the field,\n",
      "exhibiting his prowess. Whirling them before him, and whirling them on\n",
      "high, now shaking them and now jumping up himself, from the manner of his\n",
      "handling those weapons, it seemed that (with him) there is no difference\n",
      "between that offensive and that defensive weapons. Jumping suddenly then\n",
      "upon the shafts of Paurava's car, he roared aloud. Mounting next upon his\n",
      "car, he seized Paurava by the hair, and slaying meanwhile with a kick,\n",
      "the latter's driver, he felled his standard with a stroke of his sword.\n",
      "And as regards Paurava himself, Abhimanyu raised him up, like the Garuda\n",
      "raising a snake from the bottom of the sea agitating the waters.\n",
      "Thereupon, all the kings beheld Paurava (standing helpless) with\n",
      "dishevelled hair, and looking like an ox deprived of its senses while on\n",
      "the point of being slain by a lion. Beholding Paurava thus prostrated,\n",
      "placed under the control of Arjuna's son, and dragged helplessly,\n",
      "Jayadratha was unable to brook it. Taking up a sword as also a shield\n",
      "that bore the device of a peacock and was decked with a hundred bells of\n",
      "small size suspended in rows, Jayadratha jumped down from his car with a\n",

      "hurled by his foes--Arjuna's son cut off by means of his sword or warded\n",
      "off by his shield. Thus showing unto all the warriors the strength of his\n",

      "and heavy sword as also his shield,[28] proceeded towards\n",
      "Vriddhakshatra's son who was a sworn foe of his (Abhimanyu's) father,\n",

      "claws and teeth. And none could notice any difference between those two\n",
      "lions among men as regards the whirl-strokes, and descent of their swords\n",
      "and shields.[29] And as regards the descent and the whiz of their swords,\n",
      "and the warding off of each other's blows, it seemed there was no\n",
      "distinction between the two. Coursing, beautifully in outward and inward\n",
      "tracks, those two illustrious warriors seemed to be like two winged\n",
      "mountains. Then Jayadratha struck on the shield of the renowned Abhimanyu\n",
      "when the latter stretched his sword for making a pass at him. Then, O\n",

      "retreated six steps and was seen within a twinkle of the eye to be\n",
      "mounted on his own car. Then Arjuna's son also, that combat with the\n",

      "jumping up, caught hold of that dart, like Garuda catching a mighty snake\n",
      "falling from above. And having seized it thus, Abhimanyu unsheathed his\n",
      "sword. Witnessing the great activity and might of that warrior of\n",
      "immeasurable energy, all the kings together uttered a leonine shout. Then\n",

      "with steeds and elephants and cars and weapons, as if these were dry\n",
      "leaves of trees. Borne away by the wind, O king, they looked highly\n",

      "vapour edifices in the welkin, he cut off into fragments, by means of his\n",

      "Recollecting the practices of (good) warriors, Arjuna struck not those\n",
      "combatants among the foe that had fallen down, or those that were\n",
      "retreating, or those that were unwilling to fight. Deprived of their cars\n",
      "and filled with wonder, almost all the Kauravas, turning away from the\n",
      "field, uttered cries of Oh and Alas and called upon Karna (for\n",
      "protection). Hearing that din made by the Kurus, desirous of protection,\n",
      "Adhiratha's son (Karna), loudly assuring the troops with the words 'Do\n",
      "not fear' proceeded to face Arjuna. Then (Karna) that foremost of Bharata\n",
      "car-warriors, that delighter of all the Bharatas, that first of all\n",
      "persons acquainted with weapons, invoked into existence the Agneya\n",
      "weapon. Dhananjaya, however, baffled by means of his own arrowy downpours\n",
      "the flights of arrows shot by Radha's son, that warrior of the blazing\n",
      "bow, that hero of bright shafts. And similarly, Adhiratha's son also\n",
      "baffled the shafts of Arjuna of supreme energy. Resisting Arjuna's\n",
      "weapons thus by his own, Karna uttered loud shouts and shot many shafts\n",
      "at his antagonist. Then Dhristadyumna and Bhima and the mighty\n",
      "car-warrior Satyaki, all approached Karna, and each of them pierced in\n",
      "with three straight shafts. The son of Radha, however, checking Arjuna's\n",
      "weapons by his own arrowy showers, cut off with three sharp shafts the\n",
      "bows of those three warriors. Their bows cut off, they looked like snakes\n",
      "without poison. Hurling darts at their foe from their respective cars,\n",
      "they uttered loud leonine shouts. Those fierce darts of great splendour\n",
      "and great impetuosity, looking like snakes, hurled from those mighty\n",
      "arms, coursed impetuously towards Karna's car. Cutting each of those\n",
      "darts with three straight arrows and speeding many arrows at the same\n",
      "time at Partha, the mighty Karna uttered a loud shout. Then Arjuna\n",
      "piercing Karna with seven shafts, despatched the latter's younger brother\n",
      "by means of his sharp shafts. Slaying Satrunjaya thus with six arrows,\n",
      "Partha, with a broad-headed shaft, struck off Vipatha's head as the\n",

      "therefore, as also of the Suta's son, the three uterine brothers of the\n",
      "latter were despatched by Arjuna unaided by any one. Then Bhima, jumping\n",
      "down from his own car, like a second Garuda, slew with his excellent\n",
      "sword five and ten combatants amongst those that supported Karna.\n",
      "Mounting once more on his car and taking up another bow, he pierced Karna\n",
      "with ten shafts and his charioteer and steeds with five. Dhrishtadyumna\n",
      "also taking up a sword and a bright shield; despatched Charmavarman and\n",
      "also Vrihatkshatra, the ruler of the Naishadhas. The Panchala prince\n",
      "then, mounting upon his own car and taking up another bow, pierced Karna\n",
      "with three and seventy shafts, and uttered a loud roar. Sini's grandson\n",
      "also, of splendour equal to that of Indra himself, taking up another bow\n",
      "pierced Suta's son with four and sixty shafts and roared like a lion. And\n",
      "cutting off Karna's bow with a couple of well-shot shafts, he once more\n",
      "pierced Karna on the arms and the chest with three arrows. The king\n",

      "blasted that army, scattering his sharp shafts and resembling on that\n",

      "steeds were pierced, and cars with riders were broken and mangled, and\n",
      "elephants were overthrown. And umbrellas were cut off and displaced, and\n",
      "vehicles were deprived of their wheels. And the combatants fled on all\n",
      "sides, exceedingly afflicted with arrows. Even thus progressed that\n",
      "fierce battle between those warriors and Arjuna encountering each other.\n",
      "Nothing could be distinguished. With his straight shafts, Arjuna, O\n",
      "monarch, made the hostile army tremble incessantly. Firmly devoted to\n",
      "truth, Arjuna then, of white steeds desirous of accomplishing his vow\n",
      "rushed against the foremost of car-warriors, viz., Drona of red steeds.\n",
      "Then the preceptor, Drona, struck his disciple, viz., the mighty bowman\n",

      "quickly rushed against Drona, shooting arrows capable of baffling the\n",

      "Brahma weapon, Arjuna, of immeasurable soul, baffled with his straight\n",
      "shafts those shot so speedily at him by Drona. The skill we then beheld\n",
      "of Drona was exceedingly wonderful, since Arjuna, though young, and\n",
      "though struggling vigorously, could not pierce Drona with a single shaft.\n",
      "Like a mass of clouds pouring torrents of rain, the Drona cloud rained\n",
      "shower on the Partha-mountain. Possessed of great energy, Arjuna received\n",
      "that arrowy downpour, O king, by invoking the Brahma weapon, and cut off\n",
      "all those arrows by arrows of his own. Drona then afflicted Partha of\n",
      "white steeds with five and twenty arrows. And he struck Vasudeva with\n",
      "seventy arrows on the chest and arms. Partha then, of great intelligence,\n",
      "smiling the while resisted the preceptor in that battle who was\n",
      "incessantly shooting sharp arrows. Then those two foremost of\n",
      "car-warriors, while thus struck by Drona, avoided that invincible\n",
      "warrior, who resembled the raging Yuga fire. Avoiding those sharp shafts\n",
      "shot from Drona's bow, the diadem-decked son of Kunti, adorned with\n",
      "garlands of flowers, began to slaughter the host of the Bhojas. Indeed,\n",
      "avoiding the invincible Drona who stood immovable like the Mainaka\n",
      "mountain, Arjuna took up his position between Kritavarman and Sudakshina\n",
      "the ruler of the Kamvojas. Then that tiger among men, viz., the ruler of\n",
      "the Bhojas, coolly pierced that invincible and foremost descendant of\n",
      "Ruru with ten arrows winged with Kanka feathers. Then Arjuna pierced him,\n",
      "O monarch, in that battle with a hundred arrows. And once more he pierced\n",
      "him with three other arrows, stupefying that hero of the Satwata race.\n",
      "The ruler of the Bhojas then, laughing the while, pierced Partha and\n",
      "Vasudeva each with five and twenty arrows. Arjuna then, cutting off\n",
      "Kritavarman's bow, pierced him with one and twenty arrows resembling\n",

      "Kritavarman, that mighty car-warrior, taking up another bow, pierced\n",
      "Arjuna in the chest, O Bharata, with five arrows. And once more he\n",
      "pierced Partha with five sharp arrows. Then Partha struck him in return\n",

      "obstructed before the car of Kritavarman, he of Vrishni's race thought\n",

      "not show any mercy to Kritavarman! Disregarding thy relationship (with\n",
      "him), crush and slay him!' Then Arjuna, stupefying Kritavarman with his\n",

      "shooting three arrows and Uttamaujas shooting three cut off Kritavarman's\n",

      "becoming infuriated with rage, deprived both those warriors of their bows\n",
      "and covered them with arrows. Then those two warriors, taking up and\n",
      "stringing two other bows, began to pierce Kritavarman. Meanwhile Vibhatsu\n",
      "penetrated into the hostile army. But those two princes, resisted by\n",
      "Kritavarman, obtained no admittance into the Dhritarashtra host, although\n",
      "those bulls among men struggled vigorously. Then Arjuna of white steeds\n",
      "quickly afflicted in that battle the divisions opposed to him. That\n",
      "slayer of foes, however, slew not Kritavarman although he had got him\n",
      "within reach.. Beholding Partha thus proceeding, the brave king\n",
      "Srutayudha, filled with wrath, rushed at him, shaking his large bow. And\n",
      "he pierced Partha with three arrows, and Janardana with seventy. And he\n",
      "struck the standard of Partha with a very sharp arrow having a razor-like\n",
      "head. Then Arjuna, filled with wrath deeply pierced his antagonist with\n",
      "ninety straight shafts, like (a rider) striking a mighty elephant with\n",
      "the hook. Srutayudha, however, could not, O king, brook that act of\n",
      "prowess on the part of Pandu's son. He pierced Arjuna in return with\n",
      "seven and seventy shafts. Arjuna then cut off Srutayudha's bow and then\n",
      "his quiver, and angrily struck him on the chest with seven straight\n",
      "shafts. Then, king Srutayudha, deprived of his senses by wrath, took up\n",
      "another bow and struck the son of Vasava with nine arrows on the latter's\n",
      "arms and chest. Then Arjuna, that chastiser of foes laughing the while, O\n",
      "Bharata, afflicted Srutayudha with many thousands of arrows. And that\n",
      "mighty car-warrior quickly slew also the latter's steeds and charioteer.\n",
      "Endued with great strength the son of Pandu then pierced his foe with\n",
      "seventy arrows. Then the valiant king Srutayudha abandoning that\n",
      "steedless car, rushed in that encounter against Partha, uplifting his\n",
      "mace. The heroic king Srutayudha was the son of Varuna, having for his\n",
      "mother that mighty river of cool water called Parnasa. His mother, O\n",
      "king, had for the sake of her son, begged Varuna saying, 'Let this my son\n",
      "become unslayable on earth.' Varuna, gratified (with her), had said, 'I\n",
      "give him a boon highly beneficial to him, viz., a celestial weapon, by\n",
      "virtue of which this thy son will become unslayable on earth by foes. No\n",
      "man can have immortality. O foremost of rivers, every one who hath taken\n",
      "birth must inevitably die. This child, however, will always be invincible\n",
      "by foes in battle, through the power of this weapon. Therefore, let thy\n",
      "heart's fever be dispelled.' Having said these words, Varuna gave him,\n",
      "with mantras, a mace. Obtaining that mace, Srutayudha became invincible\n",
      "on earth. Unto him, however, illustrious Lord of the waters again said,\n",
      "'This mace should not be hurled at one who is not engaged in fight. If\n",
      "hurled at such a person, it will come back and fall upon thyself. O\n",
      "illustrious child, (if so hurled) it will then course in an opposite\n",
      "direction and slay the person hurling it.' It would seem that when his\n",
      "hour came, Srutayudha disobeyed that injunction. With that hero-slaying\n",
      "mace he attacked Janardana, The valiant Krishna received that mace on one\n",
      "of his well-formed and stout shoulders. It failed to shake Sauri, like\n",
      "the wind failing to shake the Vindhya mountain. That mace, returning unto\n",
      "Srutayudha himself, struck that brave and wrathful king staying on his\n",
      "car, like an ill-accomplished act of sorcery injuring the performer\n",
      "himself, and slaying that hero fell down on the earth. Beholding the mace\n",
      "turn back and Srutayudha slain, loud cries of Alas and Oh arose there\n",
      "among the troops, at the sight of Srutayudha that chastiser of foes,\n",
      "slain by a weapon of his own.[137] And because, O monarch, Srutayudha had\n",
      "hurled that mace at Janardana who was not engaged in fighting it slew him\n",
      "who had hurled it. And Srutayudha perished on the field, even in the\n",
      "manner that Varuna had indicated. Deprived of life, he fell down on the\n",
      "earth before the eyes of all the bowmen. While falling down, that dear\n",
      "son of Parnasa shone resplendent like a tall banian with spreading boughs\n",
      "broken by the wind. Then all the troops and even all the principal\n",
      "warriors fled away, beholding Srutayudha, that chastiser of foes, slain.\n",
      "Then, the son of the ruler of the Kamvojas, viz., the brave Sudakshina,\n",
      "rushed on his swift steeds against Phalguna that slayer of foes. Partha,\n",
      "then, O Bharata, sped seven shafts at him. Those shafts passing through\n",
      "the body of that hero, entered the earth. Deeply pierced those shafts\n",
      "sped in battle from Gandiva, Sudakshina pierced Arjuna in return with ten\n",
      "shafts winged with Kanka feathers. And piercing Vasudeva with three\n",
      "shafts, he once more pierced Partha with five. Then, O sire, Partha,\n",
      "cutting off Sudakshina's bow, lopped off the latter's standard. And the\n",
      "son of Pandu pierced his antagonist with a couple of broad-headed arrows\n",
      "of great sharpness. Sudakshina, however, piercing Partha once more with\n",
      "three arrows, uttered a leonine shout. Then the brave Sudakshina, filled\n",
      "with wrath, hurled at the wielder of Gandiva a terrible dart made wholly\n",
      "of iron and decked with bells. That dart blazing as a large meteor, and\n",
      "emitting sparks of fire, approaching that mighty car-warrior pierced him\n",
      "through and fell down on the earth. Deeply struck by that dart and\n",
      "overcome with a swoon, Arjuna soon enough recovered. Then that hero of\n",
      "mighty energy, licking the corners of his mouth, that son of Pandu, of\n",
      "inconceivable feats, pierced his foe, along with his steeds, standard,\n",
      "bow, and charioteer, with four and ten shafts winged with Kanka feathers.\n",
      "With other arrows, countless in number, Partha then cut Sudakshina's car\n",

      "desirous, for the sake of thy son, to compass the destruction of Arjuna,\n",

      "stupefying Kesava also (by that act). Meanwhile, the mighty car-warrior\n",

      "the act he seemed to pour an acid upon the wound of the high-souled son\n",
      "of Pandu. Deeply pierced therewith, Partha supported himself by seizing\n",

      "urged them forward, struck with Partha's shafts, vomited blood, or\n",
      "uttered shrieks of agony, or fell down, or ran ungovernably in all\n",

      "own men. And many which were kept as reserves and which were fierce as\n",
      "snakes of virulent poison, did the same. And many terrible Yavanas and\n",
      "Paradas and Sakas and Valhikas, and Mlecchas born of the cow (belonging\n",

      "thousands, of bands, and together forming a force that was countless,\n",

      "arrows, shot from Gandiva, looked like flights of locusts, as they\n",
      "coursed through the welkin. Indeed. Dhananjaya, having by his arrows\n",
      "caused a shade over the troops like that of the clouds, slew, by the\n",

      "elephants constituted its embankments. The showers of shafts poured\n",
      "constituted its rafts and the hairs of the combatants formed its moss and\n",
      "weeds. And the fingers cut off from the arms of warriors, formed its\n",
      "little fishes. And that river was as awful as Death itself at the end of\n",
      "the Yuga. And that river of blood flowed towards the region of Yama, and\n",
      "the bodies of stain elephants floating on it, obstructed its current. And\n",
      "the earth was covered all over with the blood of Kshatriyas and of\n",
      "elephants and steeds and their riders, and became one bloody expanse like\n",
      "to what is seen when Indra showers a heavy down-pour covering uplands and\n",
      "lowlands alike. And that bull among Kshatriyas despatched six thousand\n",
      "horsemen and again a thousand foremost of Kshatriyas in that battle into\n",
      "the jaws of death. Thousands of well-equipped elephants, pierced with\n",

      "vast masses of men. Deluging the earth with blood by means of his shafts,\n",
      "endued with the strength of the thunder, Dhananjaya, excited with wrath,\n",
      "penetrated into the Bharata host. While thus proceeding, Srutayus, the\n",

      "felled with keen shafts equipped with Kanka feathers, the steeds of\n",
      "Srutayus struggling in battle. And cutting off with other shafts, the bow\n",
      "also of his antagonist, Partha careered over the field. The ruler of the\n",
      "Amvashthas, then with eyes troubled in wrath, took up a mace and\n",

      "invincible battle, in might pass easily (through the Kaurava host). Many\n",
      "mighty car-warriors will struggle for vanquishing him.' The great\n",
      "car-warriors (of the Pandava army). saying this, fell impetuously upon\n",
      "their foes. Indeed, they all rushed, saying, 'We will vanquish those that\n",
      "will endeavour to vanquish Satyaki.' Then a loud uproar was heard about\n",
      "the car of Satyaki. Thy son's host, however, covered with Satyaki's\n",
      "shafts, fled away. Indeed, O king that host was broken into a hundred\n",
      "struggling bodies by him of the Satwata race. And while that force was\n",
      "breaking, that mighty car-warrior, viz., the (grandson) of Sini, crushed\n",
      "seven heroic and great bowmen in the front rank of the foe. And, O\n",
      "monarch, with his shafts that resembled blazing flames of fire, he\n",
      "despatched many other heroes, kings of diverse realms, unto the region of\n",
      "Yama. He sometimes pierced a hundred warriors with one shaft, and\n",
      "sometimes one warrior with a hundred shafts. Like the great Rudra\n",
      "destroying creatures, he slew elephant-riders and car-warriors with\n",
      "steeds and drivers. None amongst thy troops ventured to advance against\n",
      "Satyaki who was displaying such lightness of hand and who showered such\n",
      "clouds of shafts. Struck with panic and crushed grounded thus by that\n",
      "hero of long arms, those brave warriors all left the field at the sight\n",
      "of that proud hero. Although alone, they saw him multiplied manifold, and\n",
      "were stupefied by his energy. And the earth looked exceedingly beautiful\n",
      "with crushed cars and broken nidas,[150] O sire, and wheels and fallen\n",
      "umbrellas and standards and anukarshas, and banners, and headgears decked\n",
      "with gold, and human arms smeared with sandal-paste and adorned with\n",
      "Angadas, O king, and human thighs, resembling trunks of elephants or the\n",
      "tapering bodies of snakes, and faces, beautiful as the moon and decked\n",
      "with ear-rings, of large-eyed warriors lying all about the field. And the\n",
      "ground there looked exceedingly beautiful with the huge bodies of fallen\n",
      "elephants, cut off in diverse ways, like a large plain strewn with hills.\n",
      "Crushed by that hero of long arms, steeds, deprived of life and fallen\n",
      "down on the ground, looked beautiful in their traces made of burnished\n",
      "gold and decked with rows of pearls, and in their carcasses of handsome\n",
      "make and design. Having slain diverse kinds of thy troops, he of the\n",
      "Satwata race entered into thy host, agitating and routing thy army. Then\n",
      "Satyaki desired to go by that very track by which Dhananjaya had gone\n",
      "before him. Then Drona came and resisted him. Encountering the son of\n",
      "Bharadwaja, Yuyudhana., filled with rage, stopped not like a vast expanse\n",
      "of water upon encountering on embankment. Drona, however, checking in\n",
      "that battle the mighty car-warrior Yuyudhana, pierced him with five keen\n",
      "shafts, capable of penetrating into the very vitals. Satyaki, however, O\n",
      "king, in that battle pierced Drona with seven shafts whetted on stone,\n",
      "equipped with golden wings and the feathers of the Kanka and the peacock.\n",
      "Then Drona, afflicted Satyaki, his steeds and the drivers, with six\n",
      "shafts. The mighty car-warrior Yuyudhana could not brook that feat of\n",
      "Drona. Uttering a leonine shout, he then pierced Drona with ten shafts,\n",
      "and then with six, and then with eight others. And once more Yuyudhana\n",
      "pierced Drona with ten shafts, his charioteer with one and his four\n",
      "steeds with four. And with another shaft, O sire, Satyaki struck Drona's\n",
      "standard. Then, Drona speedily covered Satyaki, his car, steeds, driver,\n",
      "and standard, with swiftly coursing shafts, countless in number like a\n",
      "flight of locusts. Similarly, Yuyudhana fearlessly covered Drona with\n",
      "countless shafts of great speed. Then Drona, addressing Yuyudhana, said,\n",
      "'Thy preceptor (Arjuna) hath, like a coward, gone away, leaving the\n",
      "battle, avoiding me who was fighting with him, proceeding by my flank. O\n",
      "thou of Madhu's race, if like thy preceptor, thou too dost not quickly\n",

      "be thou, O Brahmana, I would lose time (if I fight with thee). A disciple\n",

      "progress. Proceed carefully, O Suta, in battle and listen to these grave\n",
      "words of mine. Yonder is seen the host of great splendour of Avantis.\n",
      "Next to them, is the mighty host of the Southerners. And next to it, is\n",
      "the great host of the Valhikas. By the side of the Valhikas, stands\n",
      "resolved for fight the mighty host commanded by Karna. O charioteer, all\n",
      "these hosts are different from one another, but relying upon one another,\n",
      "they protect one another on the field of battle. Arrived at the space\n",
      "left open between these divisions cheerfully urge thou the steed. Indeed,\n",
      "O charioteer, bear me thither, making the steeds adopt a tolerable\n",
      "speed,--thither, that is, where are seen the Valhikas with diverse\n",
      "weapons uplifted in their arms, and the countless Southerners headed by\n",
      "the Suta's son and whose division is seen to present a serried array of\n",
      "elephants and steeds and cars and in which stand foot-soldiers from\n",
      "various realm.' Having said this much unto his driver, avoiding the\n",
      "Brahmana (Drona), he proceeded, telling his charioteer, Pass through the\n",
      "open space between those two divisions towards the fierce and mighty host\n",
      "of Karna.' Drona, however, excited with wrath, pursued him from behind,\n",
      "shooting at him countless shafts. Indeed, the preceptor closely followed\n",
      "highly blessed Yuyudhana who advanced without any desire of turning back.\n",
      "Smiting the great host of Karna with whetted arrows, Satyaki penetrated\n",
      "into the vast and limitless army of the Bharatas. When Yuyudhana,\n",
      "however, entered the army, the troops (opposed to him) fled away. At\n",
      "this, wrathful Kritavarman came forward to resist Satyaki. The valiant\n",
      "Satyaki striking the advancing Kritavarman with six shafts, quickly slew\n",
      "his four steeds with four other shafts. And once again, he pierced\n",
      "Kritavarman in the centre of the chest with four other shafts. And once\n",
      "again, he pierced Kritavarman in the centre of the chest with sixteen\n",
      "straight shafts of great speed. Thus encountered; O monarch; with many\n",
      "shafts of fierce energy by him of the Satwata race, Kritavarman was\n",
      "unable to brook it. Aiming then a calf-toothed shaft resembling a shake\n",
      "of virulent poison and endued With the speed of the wind, and drawing the\n",
      "bow-string, O monarch, to his ear, he pierced Satyaki in the chest. That\n",
      "shaft, equipped with beautiful feathers, penetrating through his armour\n",
      "and body, and dyed in blood, entered the earth. Then, O king,\n",
      "Kritavarman, that warrior equipped with the highest weapons, shooting\n",
      "many shafts, cut off the bow of Satyaki with arrows fixed thereon. And\n",
      "excited with rage, he then, in that battle, O king, pierced Satyaki of\n",
      "unbaffled prowess in the centre of the chest with ten shafts of great\n",
      "keenness. Upon his bow being broken, the foremost of mighty men, viz.,\n",
      "Satyaki, hurled a dart at the right arm of Kritavarman. And taking up and\n",
      "drawing a tougher bow, Yuyudhana quickly shot at his foe, shafts by\n",
      "hundreds and thousands and entirely shrouded Kritavarman and his car with\n",
      "that arrowy downpour. Having thus shrouded the son of Hridika, O monarch,\n",
      "in that battle, Satyaki cut of, with a broad-headed arrow, the head of\n",
      "his foe's charioteer from his trunk. The charioteer of Hridika's son\n",
      "then, thus slain, fell down from that great car. At this, the steeds of\n",
      "Kritavarman, deprived of a driver, ran away with great speed. The ruler\n",
      "of the Bhojas, then, in great agitation, himself checked those steeds.\n",
      "That heroic warrior then, bow in hand, stood upon his car (ready for\n",
      "battle). Beholding this feat, his troops applauded it highly. Resting for\n",
      "a short space of time, Kritavarman then urged those good steeds of his.\n",
      "Himself devoid of fear, he inspired his foes with great fear. Satyaki,\n",
      "however, had by that time, left him behind, while Kritavarman himself now\n",
      "rushed against Bhimasena without pursuing Satyaki. Thus issuing out of\n",
      "the division of the Bhojas, Satyaki proceeded with great speed towards\n",
      "the mighty division of the Kamvojas. Resisted there by many brave and\n",
      "mighty car-warriors, Yuyudhana, of prowess incapable of being thwarted,\n",
      "could not then, O monarch, proceed a step. Meanwhile, Drona, having\n",
      "placed his troops in a proper position and made over the burthen of their\n",
      "protection to the ruler of the Bhojas, firmly resolved, proceeded with\n",
      "great speed towards Yuyudhana from desire of battle. Then the foremost\n",
      "warriors of the Pandava host, beholding Drona thus pursuing Yuyudhana\n",
      "from behind, cheerfully began to resist him. The Panchalas, however, who\n",
      "were headed by Bhimasena, having approached the son of Hridika, that\n",

      "they had become a little heartless, struggled yet with great vigour.\n",
      "Fearlessly he weakened, by means of his arrowy showers, the animals of\n",

      "destitute of wings, still resemble the winged tenants of the air. It\n",

      "thine is to be seen in the beginning, in the middle, or at the end. This\n",
      "defeat is entirely owing to thee. Therefore, knowing as thou dost the\n",
      "truth about this world, be quiet and hear how this fierce battle,\n",
      "resembling that between the gods and the Asuras, took place. After the\n",
      "grandson of Sini, that warrior of prowess incapable of being baffled, had\n",
      "entered into thy host, the Parthas headed by Bhimasena also rushed\n",
      "against thy troops. The mighty car-warrior Kritavarman, however, alone,\n",
      "resisted, in that battle the Pandavas thus rushing in fury and wrath with\n",
      "their followers against thy host. As the continent resists the surgings,\n",
      "even so did the son of Hridika resist the troops of the Pandavas in that\n",
      "battle. The prowess that we then beheld of the son of Hridika was\n",
      "wonderful, inasmuch as the united Parthas succeeded not in transgressing\n",
      "his single self. Then the mighty-armed Bhima, piercing Kritavarman with\n",
      "three shafts, blew his conch, gladdening all the Pandavas. Then Sahadeva\n",
      "pierced the son of Hridika with twenty shafts, and Yudhishthira the just\n",
      "pierced him with five and Nakula pierced him with a hundred. And the sons\n",

      "Then mighty Bhima, deeply pierced with those excellent shafts of\n",
      "Hridika's son, trembled on his car like a mountain during an earthquake.\n",

      "they cheerfully began to pierce him with their shafts, desiring to\n",
      "protect the Wind-god's son in that battle. Then mighty Bhimasena\n",
      "recovering consciousness, took up in that battle a dart made of steel and\n",
      "equipped with a golden staff, and hurled it with great speed from his own\n",

      "that frightful and unfordable flood. Strewn with infuriated elephants\n",
      "whose trunks or tusks had been cut off, with steeds deprived of hoofs or\n",
      "necks, with cars reduced to pieces, with warriors having their entrails\n",
      "drawn out and others with legs or other limbs cut off, with bodies lying\n",
      "in hundreds and thousands that were either perfectly still or moving\n",
      "unconsciously, we beheld the vast field, on which Partha battled,\n",
      "resembled the coveted arena of Death, O king, enhancing the terrors of\n",
      "the timid, or like the sporting ground of Rudra when he destroyed\n",
      "creatures in days of old. Portions of the field, strewn with the trunks\n",
      "of elephants cut off with razor-headed arrows, looked as if strewn with\n",
      "snakes. Portions, again, covered with the cut-off heads of warriors,\n",
      "looked as if strewn with garlands of lotuses. Variegated with beautiful\n",
      "head-gear and crowns, Keyuras and Angadas and car-rings with coats of\n",
      "mail decked with gold, and with the trappings and other ornaments of\n",
      "elephants and steeds, and scattered over with hundreds of diadems, lying\n",
      "here and there, and the earth looked exceedingly beautiful like a new\n",
      "bride. Dhananjaya then caused a fierce and terrible river full of fearful\n",
      "objects and enhancing the fear of the timid, to flow resembling the\n",
      "Vaitarani itself. The marrow and fat (of men and animals) formed its\n",
      "mire. Blood formed its current. Full of limbs and bones, it was\n",
      "fathomless in depth. The hairs of creatures formed its moss and weeds.\n",
      "Heads and arms formed the stones on its shores. It was decked with\n",
      "standards and banners that variegated its aspect. Umbrellas and bows\n",
      "formed the waves. And it abounded with bodies of huge elephants deprived\n",
      "of life, and it teemed with cars that formed hundreds of rafts floating\n",
      "on its surface. And the carcases of countless steeds formed its banks.\n",
      "And it was difficult to cross in consequence of wheels and yokes and\n",
      "shafts and Akshas and Kuveras of cars, and spears and swords and darts\n",
      "and battle-axes and shafts looking like snakes. And ravens and kankas\n",

      "in consequence of the howls of jackals. And it abounded with capering\n",
      "ghosts and Pisachas and thousands of other kinds of spirits. And on it\n",
      "floated countless bodies of warriors destitute of life. Beholding that\n",
      "prowess of Arjuna whose visage then resembled that of the Destroyer\n",
      "himself, a panic, such as had never occurred before, possessed the Kurus\n",
      "on the field of battle. The son of Pandu, then, baffling with his weapons\n",
      "those of the hostile heroes, and engaged in achieving fierce feats, gave\n",
      "all to understand that he was a warrior of fierce feats. Then Arjuna\n",
      "transgressed all those foremost of car-warriors, like the midday sun of\n",
      "scorching rays in the firmament, no one amongst the creatures there could\n",

      "illustrious hero in that battle, seemed to us to resemble a row of cranes\n",
      "in the welkin. Baffling with his own the weapons of all those heroes, and\n",
      "showing by the terrible achievements in which he was engaged that he was\n",
      "a warrior of fierce feats. Arjuna, desirous of slaying Jayadratha,\n",
      "transgressed all those foremost of car-warriors, stupefying them all by\n",
      "means of his shafts. Shooting his shafts on all sides, Dhananjaya, having\n",
      "Krishna for his charioteer, presented a beautiful sight by careering with\n",
      "great speed on the field of battle. The shafts in the welkin, by hundreds\n",
      "and thousands, of that illustrious hero, seemed to course incessantly\n",
      "through the sky. We never could notice when that mighty bowman took out\n",
      "his shafts, when indeed, that son of Pandu aimed them, and when he let\n",
      "them off. Then, O king, filling all the points of the compass with his\n",
      "shafts and afflicting all the car-warriors in battle, the son of Kunti\n",
      "proceeded towards Jayadratha and pierced him with four and sixty straight\n",
      "arrows. Then the Kuru warriors, beholding the son of Pandu proceeded\n",
      "towards Jayadratha, all abstained from battle. In fact, those heroes\n",
      "became hopeless of Jayadratha's life. Every one amongst thy warriors that\n",
      "rushed in that fierce battle against the son of Pandu, had his body\n",
      "deeply pierced, O lord, with a shaft of Arjuna. The mighty car-warrior\n",
      "Arjuna, that foremost of victorious persons, with his shafts blazing as\n",
      "fire made thy army teem with headless trunks.[175] Indeed, O king, thus\n",
      "creating a perfect confusion in thy host consisting of four kinds of\n",
      "forces, the son of Kunti proceeded towards Jayadratha, And he pierced the\n",
      "son of Drona. with fifty shafts and Vrishasena with three. And the son of\n",
      "Kunti mildly struck Kripa with nine arrows, and he struck Salya with\n",
      "sixteen arrows and Karna with two and thirty. And piercing the ruler of\n",
      "the Sindhus then with four and sixty arrows, he uttered a leonine shout.\n",
      "The ruler of the Sindhus, however, thus pierced by the wielder of Gandiva\n",
      "with his arrows, became filled with rage and unable to brook it, like an\n",
      "elephant when pierced with the hook. Bearing the device of the boar on\n",
      "his banner, he quickly sped towards Phalguna's car many straight shafts\n",
      "equipped with vulturine feathers, resembling angry snakes of virulent\n",
      "poison, well-polished by the hands of the smith, and shot from his bow\n",
      "drawn to the fullest stretch. Then piercing Govinda with three shafts, he\n",
      "struck Arjuna with six. And then he pierced the steeds of Arjuna with\n",
      "eight arrows and his standard also with one. Then Arjuna, baffling the\n",
      "keen arrows sped by the ruler of the Sindhus, cut off at the same time,\n",
      "with a pair of shafts, the head of Jayadratha's driver and the\n",
      "well-decked standard also of Jayadratha. Its stay cut off and itself\n",
      "pierced and struck with arrows, that standard fell down like a flame of\n",
      "fire. Meanwhile, the sun was going down quickly. Janardana then quickly\n",
      "addressed the son of Pandu and said, 'Behold, O Partha, the ruler of the\n",
      "Sindhus hath, by six mighty and heroic car-warriors, been placed in\n",
      "their-midst! Jayadratha also, O mighty-armed one, is waiting there in\n",
      "fear! Without vanquishing those six car-warriors in battle, O bull among\n",
      "men, thou wilt never be able to slay the ruler of the Sindhus even if\n",
      "thou exertest thyself without intermission. I shall, therefore, resort to\n",
      "Yoga for shrouding the sun. Then the ruler of the Sindhus will (in\n",
      "consequence) behold the sun to have set. Desirous of life, O lord,\n",
      "through joy that wicked wight will no longer, for his destruction,\n",
      "conceal himself. Availing yourself of that opportunity, thou shouldst\n",
      "then, O best of the Kurus, strike him. Thou shouldst not give up the\n",
      "enterprise, thinking the sun to have really set.' Hearing these words,\n",
      "Vibhatsu replied unto Kesava, saying, 'Let it be so.' Then Krishna\n",
      "otherwise called Hari, possessed of ascetic powers, that lord of all\n",
      "ascetics, having taken recourse to Yoga, created that darkness. Thy\n",
      "warriors, O king, thinking the sun to have set were filled with delight\n",
      "at the prospect of Partha's laying down his life. Indeed, thy warriors,\n",
      "not seeing the sun, were filled with gladness. All of them stood, with\n",
      "heads thrown backwards. King Jayadratha also was in the same attitude.\n",
      "And while the ruler of the Sindhus was thus beholding the sun, Krishna,\n",
      "once more addressing Dhananjaya said these words, 'Behold, the heroic\n",
      "ruler of the Sindhus is now looking at the sun, casting off his fear of\n",
      "thee, O foremost one among the Bharatas! This is the hour, O mighty-armed\n",
      "one, for the slaughter of that wicked-souled wretch. Speedily cut off the\n",
      "head and make thy vow true.' Thus addressed by Kesava the valiant son of\n",
      "Pandu began to slaughter thy host with his arrows resembling the sun or\n",
      "fire in splendour. And he pierced Kripa with twenty arrows and Karna with\n",
      "fifty. And he struck Salya and Duryodhana each with six. And he pierced\n",
      "Vrishasena with eight arrows and the ruler of the Sindhus himself with\n",
      "sixty. And the mighty-armed son of Pandu, O king, deeply piercing with\n",
      "his arrows the other warriors of thy host, rushed against Jayadratha.\n",
      "Beholding him in their presence like a swelling fire with its tongue of\n",
      "flame outstretched, the protectors of Jayadratha were sorely puzzled.\n",
      "Then all the warriors, O king, desirous of victory bathed the son of\n",
      "Indra in that battle with torrents of arrows. Shrouded with incessant\n",
      "showers of arrows, the son of Kunti, that mighty-armed and unvanquished\n",
      "descendant of Kuru, became filled with rage. Then that tiger among men,\n",
      "viz., the son of Indra, desirous of slaughtering thy host, created a\n",
      "thick net of arrows. Then those warriors of thine, O king, thus\n",
      "slaughtered in battle by that hero, abandoned the ruler of the Sindhus in\n",
      "fear and fled away. And they fled away in such a manner that no two\n",
      "persons could be seen flying together. The prowess that we then beheld of\n",
      "Kunti's son was extremely wonderful. Indeed, the like of what that\n",
      "illustrious warrior then did had never been nor will ever be. Like Rudra\n",
      "himself slaughtering creatures, Dhananjaya slaughtered elephants and\n",
      "elephant-riders, horses and horse-riders, and (car-warriors and)\n",
      "car-drivers. I did not in that battle, O king, see a single elephant or\n",
      "steed or human warrior that was not struck with Partha's shafts. Their\n",
      "vision blurred by dust and darkness, thy warriors became perfectly\n",
      "cheerless and unable to distinguish one another. Urged on by fate and\n",
      "with their vital limbs cut open and mangled with shafts, they began to\n",
      "wander or, limp, or fall down. And some amongst them, O Bharata, became\n",
      "paralysed and some became deathly pale. During that terrible carnage\n",
      "resembling the slaughter of creatures at the end of the Yuga, in that\n",
      "deadly and fierce battle from which few could escape with life, the earth\n",
      "became drenched with gore and the earthy dust that had arisen disappeared\n",
      "in consequence of the showers of blood that fell and the swift currents\n",
      "of wind that blew over the field. So deep was that rain of blood that the\n",
      "wheels of cars sank to their naves. Thousands of infuriated elephants\n",
      "endued with great speed, O king, of thy army, their riders slain and\n",
      "limbs mangled, fled away, uttering cries of pain and crushing friendly\n",
      "ranks with their tread. Steeds destitute of riders and foot-soldiers\n",
      "also, O king, fled away, O monarch, from fear, struck with the shafts of\n",
      "Dhananjaya. Indeed, thy soldiers, with dishevelled hair and deprived of\n",
      "their coats of mail, with blood streaming out of their wounds, fled away\n",
      "in terror, leaving the field of battle. And some, deprived of the power\n",
      "of motion as if their lower limbs had been seized by alligators, remained\n",
      "on the field. And others concealed themselves behind and under the bodies\n",
      "of slain elephants Routing thy host thus, O king, Dhananjaya began to\n",
      "strike with terrible shafts the protectors of the ruler of the Sindhus\n",
      "with his arrowy showers, Karna and Drona's son and Kripa and Salya and\n",
      "Vrishasena and Duryodhana. So quick was he in the use of weapons that no\n",
      "one could mark when Arjuna took out his arrows, when he fixed them on the\n",
      "bowstring, when he stretched---the bow and let them off. Indeed, while\n",
      "striking the foe, his bow was seen incessantly drawn to a circle. His\n",
      "arrows also were seen incessantly issuing out of his bow and scattered in\n",
      "all directions. Then cutting off Karna's bow as also of Vrishasena's,\n",
      "Arjuna felled Salya's driver from his niche in the car, with a\n",
      "broad-headed arrow. With many arrows that foremost of victors, viz.,\n",
      "Dhananjaya, then deeply pierced in that battle Kripa and Aswatthaman,\n",
      "related as uncle and nephew to each other. Sorely afflicting those mighty\n",
      "car-warriors of thy army thus, the son of Pandu took up a terrible arrow\n",
      "of fiery splendour. Looking like the thunderbolt of Indra, and inspired\n",
      "with divine mantras, that formidable arrow was capable of bearing any\n",
      "strain. And it had been always worshipped with incense and garlands of\n",
      "flowers. Duly inspiring it (by mantras) with the force of the\n",
      "thunderbolt, that descendant, of Kuru, viz., the mighty-armed Arjuna,\n",
      "fixed it on Gandiva. When that arrow of fiery effulgence was fixed on the\n",
      "bowstring, loud shouts, O king, were heard in the welkin. Then Janardana,\n",
      "once more addressing Arjuna, quickly said, 'O Dhananjaya, quickly cut off\n",
      "the head of the wicked-souled ruler of the Sindhus! The sun is about to\n",
      "get at the mountain of Asta. Listen, however, to the words I say about\n",
      "the slaughter of Jayadratha. The father of Jayadratha is Vriddhakshatra\n",
      "known all over the world. It was after a long time that he got\n",
      "Jayadratha, that slayer of foes, for his son. (At the birth of the son)\n",
      "an incorporeal and invisible voice, deep as that of the clouds or of the\n",
      "drum, said unto king Vriddhakshatra. 'This thy son, O lord, amongst men\n",
      "in this world will become worthy of the two races (viz., the Solar and\n",
      "the Lunar) in respect of blood, behaviour, self-restraint and the other\n",
      "attributes. He will become one of the foremost of Kshatriyas, and will\n",
      "always be worshipped by heroes. But while struggling in battle, some bull\n",
      "among the Kshatriyas, some conspicuous person in the world, excited with\n",
      "wrath, will cut off this one's head.' That chastiser of foes, viz., the\n",
      "(old) ruler of the Sindhus, hearing these words, reflected for sometime.\n",
      "Overwhelmed with affection for his son, he summoned all his kinsmen and\n",
      "said, 'That man who will cause the head of my son to fall on the earth\n",
      "while the latter, struggling in battle, will be bearing a great burthen,\n",
      "I say that the head of that man will certainly crack into a hundred\n",
      "pieces.' Having spoken these words and installed Jayadratha on the\n",
      "throne, Vriddhakshatra, repairing to the woods, devoted himself to\n",
      "ascetic austerities. Endued with great energy, he is still engaged in the\n",
      "observance of the austerest of penances outside this very\n",
      "Samantapanchaka, O ape-bannered one! Therefore, cutting off Jayadratha's\n",
      "head in this dreadful battle, thou, O slayer of foes, shouldst, O\n",
      "Bharata, by thy fierce celestial weapon of wonderful feats, quickly throw\n",
      "that head decked with car-rings upon the lap of Vriddhakshatra himself, O\n",
      "younger brother of the son of the Wind-god! If thou fellest Jayadratha's\n",
      "head on the earth, thy own head, then, without doubt, will crack into a\n",
      "hundred fragments. Aided by thy celestial weapon, do thee deed in such a\n",
      "way that the lord of earth viz., the old Sindhu king, may not know that\n",
      "it is done. Truly, O Arjuna, there is nothing in the three worlds which\n",
      "thou canst not achieve or do, O son of Vasava!' Hearing these words (of\n",
      "Krishna), Dhananjaya, licking the corners of his mouth, quickly shot that\n",
      "arrow which he had taken up for Jayadratha's slaughter, that arrow, viz.,\n",
      "whose touch resembled that of Indra's thunder, which was inspired with\n",
      "mantras and converted into a celestial weapon, which was capable of\n",
      "bearing any strain, and which had always been worshipped with incense and\n",
      "garlands. That shaft, sped from Gandiva, coursing swiftly, snatched\n",
      "Jayadratha's head away, like a hawk snatching away a smaller bird from\n",
      "the top of a tree. Dhananjaya, then, with his shafts, sent that head\n",
      "along in the welkin (without allowing it to fall down). For grieving his\n",
      "foes and gladdening his friends, the son of Pandu, by shooting his shafts\n",
      "repeatedly at it, sent that head outside the limits of Samantapanchaka.\n",
      "Meanwhile, king Vriddhakshatra, the father of thy son-in-law, endued with\n",
      "great energy, was, O sire, engaged in his evening prayers. Decked with\n",
      "black locks and adorned with ear-rings, that head of Jayadratha was\n",
      "thrown upon Vriddhakshatra's lap, as the latter was saying his prayers in\n",
      "a sitting posture. Thus thrown on his lap, that head decked with\n",

      "the latter, however, stood up after finishing his prayers it suddenly\n",
      "fell down on the earth. And as the head of Jayadratha fell down on the\n",
      "earth, the head of Vriddhakshatra, O chastiser of foes, cracked into a\n",
      "hundred pieces. At the sight of this, all creatures were filled with\n",

      "him advance with uplifted bow, resembling the mace-armed Destroyer\n",
      "himself in the hour of universal dissolution, the hostile kings were\n",
      "struck with fear. At sight of that prince of Rakshasas, viz.,\n",
      "Ghatotkacha, looking like a mountain summit of terrible aspect,\n",
      "frightful, possessed of terrible teeth and fierce face, with arrow-like\n",
      "ears and high cheek-bones, with stiff hair rising upwards, awful eyes,\n",
      "sunken belly, blazing mouth, wide as a chasm, and diadem on his head,\n",
      "capable of striking every creature with fear, possessing jaws wide-open\n",

      "into fierce eddies by (the action of) the wind. Terrified by the leonine\n",
      "roar uttered by Ghatotkacha, elephants began to eject urine and the kings\n",
      "began to tremble. Then, thrown by the Rakshasas who had become more\n",
      "powerful in consequence of the night, there began to fall on the field of\n",
      "battle a thick shower of stones. And a ceaseless shower of iron wheels\n",
      "and Bhundis and darts and lances and spears and Sataghnis and axes also\n",
      "fell there. Beholding that fierce and awful battle, the kings, thy sons,\n",
      "and Karna, also exceedingly pained, fled away. Only the proud son of\n",
      "Drona, ever boastful of his might in arms, stood fearlessly. And he soon\n",
      "dispelled that illusion that had been created by Ghatotkacha. Upon the\n",

      "snakes into an ant-hill. The light-handed Aswatthaman, however, of great\n",
      "prowess, filled with wrath, pierced Ghatotkacha with ten arrows.\n",
      "Ghatotkacha, deeply pierced in his vital parts by Drona's son, and\n",
      "feeling great pain, took up a wheel having a thousand spokes. Its edge\n",
      "was sharp as a razor, and it was resplendent as the rising sun. And it\n",
      "was decked with diverse gems and diamonds. Desirous of slaying him, the\n",
      "son of Bhimasena hurled that wheel at Aswatthaman. And as that wheel\n",
      "coursed swiftly towards Drona's son, the latter cut it into fragments by\n",
      "means of his shafts. Baffled, it fell down on the earth, like the hope\n",
      "cherished by an unfortunate man. Beholding his wheel baffled, Ghatotkacha\n",
      "quickly covered the son of Drona with his shafts, like Rahu swallowing\n",
      "the sun. Meanwhile, Ghatotkacha's son endued with great splendour and\n",
      "looking like a mass of antimony, checked the advancing son of Drona like\n",

      "of rain from a mighty cloud. Then Aswatthaman, equal unto Rudra or\n",
      "Upendra in prowess, became filled with rage. With one shaft he cut off\n",
      "the standard of Anjanaparvan. With two others, his two drivers, and with\n",
      "three others, his Trivenuka. And he cut off the Rakshasa's bow with one\n",
      "arrow, and his four steeds with four other arrows, Made carless,\n",
      "Anjanaparvan took up a scimitar. With another keen shaft, Aswatthaman cut\n",
      "off in two fragments that scimitar, decked with golden stars, in the\n",
      "Rakshasa's hand. The grandson of Hidimva then, O king, whirling a gold\n",
      "adorned mace, quickly hurled it at Aswatthaman. Drona's son, however,\n",
      "striking it with his shafts, caused it to fall down on the earth. Soaring\n",
      "up then into the sky, Anjanaparvan began to roar like a cloud. And from\n",
      "the welkin he showered trees upon his foe. Like the sun piercing a mass\n",
      "of clouds with his rays, Aswatthaman then began to pierce with his shafts\n",
      "the son of Ghatotkacha, that receptacle of illusions, in the welkin.\n",
      "Gifted with great energy, the Rakshasa once more came down on his gold\n",
      "decked car. He then looked like a high and beautiful hill of antimony on\n",
      "the surface of the earth. The son of Drona then slew that son of Bhima's\n",
      "son, viz., Anjanaparvan, cased in an iron coat of mail, even as Mahadeva\n",
      "had slain in days of yore the Asura Andhaka. Beholding his mighty son\n",

      "car-warriors, viz., Drona's son, shafts of the measure of Aksha of battle\n",
      "car, like a cloud pouring torrents of rain. Drona's son however, with his\n",

      "between shafts (as the combatants). The welkin, then, during the night,\n",
      "shone resplendent with the sparks caused by the clash of those weapons,\n",

      "by Drona's son, proud of his prowess in battle, Ghatotkacha, once more\n",
      "making himself invisible, created an illusion. He assumed the form of a\n",
      "high mountain, crowded with cliffs and trees, and possessing fountains\n",
      "from which ceaselessly flowed spears and lances and swords and heavy\n",
      "clubs. Beholding that mountain-like mass of antimony, with countless\n",
      "weapons falling from it, Drona's son was not at all moved. The latter\n",
      "invoked into existence the Vajra weapon.[200] The prince of mountains,\n",

      "Yudhishthira the just hath told thee this. It behoveth thee not to doubt\n",
      "this fact.' Thus addressed by Bhima, Drona laid aside his bow. Desirous\n",
      "of laying aside all his weapons also, Bharadwaja's son of virtuous soul\n",

      "down, and heaving his breast forward, and closing his eyes, and resting\n",
      "ort the quality of goodness, and disposing his heart to contemplation,\n",
      "and thinking on the monosyllable Om, representing. Brahma, and\n",
      "remembering the puissant, supreme, and indestructible God of gods, the\n",
      "radiant Drona or high ascetic merit, the preceptor (of the Kurus and the\n",
      "Pandavas) repaired to heaven that is so difficult of being attained even\n",
      "by the pious. Indeed, when Drona thus proceeded to heaven it seemed to us\n",
      "that there were then two suns in the firmament. The whole welkin was\n",
      "ablaze and seemed to be one vast expanse of equal light when the sun-like\n",
      "Bharadwaja, of solar effulgence, disappeared. Confused sounds of joy were\n",
      "heard, uttered by the delighted celestials. When Drona thus repaired to\n",
      "the region of Brahman, Dhrishtadyumna stood, unconscious of it all,\n",
      "beside him. Only we five amongst men beheld the high-souled Drona rapt in\n",

      "Pandu. Nobody else, O king, could see that glory of the wise Drona,\n",
      "devoted to Yoga, while passing out of the world. In fact, all human\n",
      "beings were unconscious of the fact that the preceptor attained to the\n",
      "supreme region of Brahman, a region mysterious to the very gods, and one\n",
      "that is the highest of all. Indeed, none of them could see the preceptor,\n",
      "that chastiser of foes, proceed to the region of Brahman, devoted to Yoga\n",
      "in the company of the foremost of Rishis, his body mangled with arrows\n",
      "and bathed in blood, after he had laid aside his weapons. As regards\n",

      "said, 'O grandson of Sini, I know thy partiality for Dhrishtadyumna, that\n",
      "slayer of his preceptor, but thou shalt not be able to rescue him or your\n",
      "own self when attacked by me. I swear to thee, O grandson of Sini, by\n",
      "truth and by my ascetic austerities, that I shall know no peace till I\n",
      "slay all the Panchalas. You may unite the forces of the Pandavas and\n",
      "those of the Vrishnis together, but I shall still slay the Somakas.\n",
      "Saying this, the son of Drona shot at Satyaki an excellent and straight\n",
      "arrow possessed of the effulgence of the sun, even as Sakra had hurled in\n",
      "days of yore his thunder at the Asura Vritra. Thus shot by Aswatthaman,\n",
      "that arrow, piercing through the armour of Satyaki, and passing through\n",
      "his body, entered the earth like a hissing snake entering its hole. His\n",

      "His bow, with arrow fixed thereon, being then loosened from his grasp, he\n",
      "sat down on the terrace of his car strengthless and covered all over with\n",
      "blood. Seeing this his driver speedily bore him away from Drona's son.\n",
      "With another shaft, perfectly straight and equipped with goodly wings\n",
      "that scorcher of foes, viz., Aswatthaman, struck Dhrishtadyumna between\n",
      "his eyebrows. The Panchala prince had before this been much pierced;\n",
      "therefore, deeply wounded by that arrow, he became exceedingly weak and\n",
      "supported himself by seizing his flag-staff. Beholding Dhrishtadyumna\n",
      "thus afflicted by Aswatthaman, like an infuriated elephant by a lion,\n",
      "five heroic car-warriors of the Pandava army, viz., Kiritin, Bhimasena,\n",
      "Vrihatkshatra of Puru's race, the youthful prince of the Chedis, and\n",
      "Sudarsana, the chief of the Malavas, quickly rushed against Aswatthaman.\n",
      "Armed with bows, all these rushed with cries Oh and Alas. And those\n",
      "heroes quickly encompassed the son of Drona on all sides. Advancing\n",
      "twenty paces, all of them, with great care, simultaneously struck the\n",
      "angry son of the preceptor with five and twenty arrows. Drona's son,\n",
      "however, with five and twenty shafts, resembling snakes of virulent\n",
      "poison, cut off, almost at the same time, those five and twenty arrows\n",
      "shot at him. Then Aswatthaman afflicted the Paurava prince with seven\n",
      "sharp shafts. And he afflicted the chief of the Malavas with three,\n",
      "Partha with one, and Vrikodara with six shafts. Then all those great\n",
      "car-warriors, O king, pierced Drona's son unitedly and separately with\n",
      "many shafts, whetted on stone equipped with wings of gold. The youthful\n",
      "prince of the Chedis pierced Drona's son with twenty and Partha pierced\n",
      "him with three. Then Drona's son struck Arjuna with six arrows, and\n",
      "Vasudeva with six, and Bhima with five, and each of the other two viz.,\n",
      "the Malava and the Paurava, with two arrows. Piercing next the driver of'\n",
      "Bhima's car with six arrows, Aswatthaman cut off Bhimasena's bow and\n",
      "standard with a couple of arrows. Then piercing Partha once more with a\n",
      "shower of arrows, Drona's son uttered a leonine roar. With the sharp,\n",
      "well-tempered, and terrible arrows shot by Drona's son, the earth, the\n",
      "sky, the firmament, and the points of the compass, cardinal and\n",
      "subsidiary, all became entirely shrouded both in his front and rear.\n",
      "Endued with fierce energy and equal to Indra himself in prowess,\n",
      "Aswatthaman with three arrows, almost simultaneously cut off the two\n",
      "arms, like unto Indra's poles, and the head of Sudarsana, as the latter\n",
      "was seated on his car. Then piercing Paurava with a dart and cutting off\n",
      "his car into minute fragments by means of his arrows, Aswatthaman lopped\n",
      "off his antagonist's two arms smeared with sandal-paste and then his head\n",
      "from off his trunk with a broad-headed shaft. Possessed of great\n",
      "activity, he then pierced with many arrows resembling blazing flames of\n",
      "fire in energy, the youthful and mighty prince of the Chedis who was of\n",
      "the hue of the dark lotus, and despatched him to Yama's abode with his\n",
      "driver and steeds. Beholding the chief of the Malavas, the descendant of\n",
      "Puru, and the youthful ruler of the Chedis slain in this very sight by\n",
      "the son of Drona.. Bhimasena, the mighty-armed son of Pandu, became\n",
      "filled with rage. The scorcher of foes then covered Drona's son in that\n",
      "battle with hundreds of keen arrows resembling angry snakes of virulent\n",
      "poison. Endued with mighty energy, the angry son of Drona then destroying\n",
      "that arrowy shower, pierced Bhimasena with sharp shafts. The mighty-armed\n",
      "Bhima then, possessed of great strength, cut off with a broad-headed\n",
      "arrow the bow of Drona's son and then pierced Drona's son himself with a\n",
      "powerful shaft. Throwing away that broken bow, the high-souled son of\n",
      "Drona took up another and pierced Bhima with his winged shafts. Then\n",
      "those two, viz., Drona's son and Bhima, both possessed of great prowess\n",
      "and might, began to shower their arrowy downpours like two masses of\n",
      "rain-charged clouds. Gold-winged arrows, whetted on stone and engraved\n",
      "with Bhima's name shrouded Drona's son, like gathering masses of clouds\n",
      "shrouding the sun. Similarly, Bhima was soon shrouded with hundreds and\n",
      "thousands of strong arrows shot by Drona's son. Though shrouded in that\n",
      "battle by Drona's son, that warrior of great skill, Bhima yet felt no\n",
      "pain, O monarch, which seemed exceedingly wonderful. Then the\n",
      "mighty-armed Bhima sped ten gold-decked arrows, of great keenness and\n",
      "resembling the darts of Yama himself, at his foe. Those shafts, O sire,\n",
      "failing upon the shoulders of Drona's son, quickly pierced his body, like\n",
      "snakes penetrating into an ant-hill. Deeply pierced by the high-souled\n",
      "son of Pandu, Aswatthaman, closing his eyes, supported himself by seizing\n",
      "his flagstaff. Recovering his senses within a moment, O king, Drona's son\n",
      "bathed in blood, mustered all his wrath. Forcibly struck by the\n",
      "high-souled son of Pandu, Aswatthaman, endued with mighty arms, rushed\n",
      "with great speed towards the car of Bhimasena. And then, O Bharata, he\n",
      "sped at Bhimasena, from his bow drawn to its fullest stretch, a hundred\n",
      "arrows of fierce energy, all looking like snakes of virulent poison.\n",
      "Pandu's son Bhima also, proud of his prowess in battle, disregarding\n",
      "Aswatthaman's energy, speedily showered upon him dense arrowy downpour.\n",
      "Then Drona's son, O king, cutting off Bhima's bow by means of his arrows,\n",
      "and filled with rage, struck the Pandava in the chest with many keen\n",
      "shafts. Incapable of brooking that feat, Bhimasena took up another bow\n",
      "and pierced Drona's son in that battle with five keen shafts. Indeed,\n",
      "showering upon each other their arrowy downpours like two masses of\n",
      "clouds at the close of summer, two warriors, with eyes red as copper in\n",
      "rage, completely covered each other in that battle with their shafts.\n",
      "Frightening each other with the terrible sounds they made by their palms,\n",
      "they continued to fight with each other, each counteracting the feats of\n",
      "the other. Then bending his formidable bow adorned with gold, Drona's son\n",
      "began to gaze steadfastly at Bhima who was thus shooting his shafts at\n",
      "him. At that time, Aswatthaman looked like the meridian sun of blazing\n",
      "rays in an autumnal day. So quickly then did he shoot his shafts that\n",
      "people could not see when he took them out of his quiver when he fixed\n",
      "them on the bowstring when he drew the string, and when he let them off.\n",
      "Indeed, when employed in shooting his arrows, his bow, O monarch, seemed\n",
      "to be incessantly drawn to fiery circle. Shafts in a hundred thousands,\n",
      "shot from his bow, seemed to course through the welkin like a flight of\n",
      "locusts. Indeed, those terrible shafts adorned with gold, shot from the\n",
      "bow of Drona's son, coursed incessantly towards Bhima's car. The prowess,\n",
      "O Bharata, that we then beheld of Bhimasena, and his might, energy, and\n",
      "spirit, were exceedingly wonderful, for, regarding that terrible shower\n",
      "of arrows thick as a gathering mass of clouds, failing around him to be\n",
      "nothing more than a downpour of rain at the close of summer. Bhima of\n",
      "terrible prowess, desirous of slaying the son of Drona, in return poured\n",
      "his arrows upon the latter like a cloud in the season of rains. Bhima's\n",
      "large and formidable bow of golden back, incessantly drawn in that\n",
      "battle, looked resplendent like a second bow of Indra. Shafts in hundreds\n",
      "and thousands, issuing from it, shrouded Drona's son, that ornament of\n",
      "battle in that encounter. The showers of shafts, shot by both of them\n",
      "were so dense, O sire, that the very wind, O king, could not find room\n",
      "for coursing through them. Then Drona's son, O king, desirous of slaying\n",
      "Bhima, sped at him many gold-decked arrows of keen points steeped in oil.\n",
      "Showing his superiority to Drona's son Bhimasena cut off each of those\n",
      "arrows into three fragments before they could come at him. The son of\n",
      "Pandu then said, 'Wait Wait.' And once more, the mighty son of Pandu\n",
      "filled with rage, and desirous of slaying the son of Drona, shot at him a\n",
      "terrible shower of fierce arrows. Then Drona's son that warrior\n",
      "acquainted with the highest weapons, quickly destroying that arrowy\n",
      "shower by the illusion of his own weapons, cut off Bhima's bow in that\n",
      "encounter. Filled with rage, he then pierced Bhima himself with\n",
      "innumerable shafts in that battle. Endued with great might, Bhima then,\n",
      "after his bow had been cut off, hurled a dart at Aswatthaman's car,\n",
      "having whirled it previously with great impetuosity. The son of Drona,\n",
      "displaying the lightness of his hand in that encounter, quickly cut off,\n",
      "by means of sharp shafts, that dart as it coursed towards him with the\n",
      "splendour of a blazing brand. Meanwhile, terrible Vrikodara, taking up a\n",
      "very strong bow, and smiling the while, began to pierce the son of Drona\n",
      "with many arrows. Then Drona's son, O monarch, with a straight shaft,\n",
      "pierced the forehead of Bhima's driver. The latter, deeply pierced by the\n",
      "mighty son of Drona, fell into a swoon, O king, abandoning the reins of\n",
      "the steeds. The driver of the Bhima's car having fallen into a swoon, the\n",
      "steeds, O king, began to fly away with great speed, in the very sight of\n",
      "all the bowmen. Beholding Bhima carried away from the field of battle by\n",
      "those running steeds, the unvanquished Aswatthaman joyfully blew his huge\n",
      "conch. Beholding Bhimasena borne away from the field, all the Panchalas,\n",
      "inspired with fear, abandoning the car of Dhrishtadyumna, fled away on\n",
      "every side. Then Drona's son, shooting his shafts fiercely, pursued those\n",
      "broken troops, causing a great carnage among them. Thus slaughtered in\n",
