       "'ADI PARVA/tII\\tII\\n\\n\"The Rishis said, \\'O son of Suta, we wish to hear a full and\\ncircumstantial account of the place mentioned by you as Samanta-panchaya.\\'\\n\\n\"Sauti said, \\'Listen, O ye Brahmanas, to the sacred descriptions I utter\\nO ye best of men, ye deserve to hear of the place known as\\nSamanta-panchaka. In the interval between the Treta and Dwapara Yugas,\\nRama (the son of Jamadagni) great among all who have borne arms, urged by\\nimpatience of wrongs, repeatedly smote the noble race of Kshatriyas. And\\nwhen that fiery meteor, by his own valour, annihilated the entire tribe\\nof the Kshatriyas, he formed at Samanta-panchaka five lakes of blood. We\\nare told that his reason being overpowered by anger he offered oblations\\nof blood to the manes of his ancestors, standing in the midst of the\\nsanguine waters of those lakes. It was then that his forefathers of whom\\nRichika was the first having arrived there addressed him thus, \\'O Rama, O\\nblessed Rama, O offspring of Bhrigu, we have been gratified with the\\nreverence thou hast shown for thy ancestors and with thy valour, O mighty\\none! Blessings be upon thee. O thou illustrious one, ask the boon that\\nthou mayst desire.\\'\\n\\n\"Rama said, \\'If, O fathers, ye are favourably disposed towards me, the\\nboon I ask is that I may be absolved from the sins born of my having\\nannihilated the Kshatriyas in anger, and that the lakes I have formed may\\nbecome famous in the world as holy shrines.\\' The Pitris then said, \\'So\\nshall it be. But be thou pacified.\\' And Rama was pacified accordingly.\\nThe region that lieth near unto those lakes of gory water, from that time\\nhath been celebrated as Samanta-panchaka the holy. The wise have declared\\nthat every country should be distinguished by a name significant of some\\ncircumstance which may have rendered it famous. In the interval between\\nthe Dwapara and the Kali Yugas there happened at Samanta-panchaka the\\nencounter between the armies of the Kauravas and the Pandavas. In that\\nholy region, without ruggedness of any kind, were assembled eighteen\\nAkshauhinis of soldiers eager for battle. And, O Brahmanas, having come\\nthereto, they were all slain on the spot. Thus the name of that region, O\\nBrahmanas, hath been explained, and the country described to you as a\\nsacred and delightful one. I have mentioned the whole of what relateth to\\nit as the region is celebrated throughout the three worlds.\\'\\n\\n\"The Rishis said, \\'We have a desire to know, O son of Suta, what is\\nimplied by the term Akshauhini that hath been used by thee. Tell us in\\nfull what is the number of horse and foot, chariots and elephants, which\\ncompose an Akshauhini for thou art fully informed.\\'\\n\\n\"Sauti said, \\'One chariot, one elephant, five foot-soldiers, and three\\nhorses form one Patti; three pattis make one Sena-mukha; three\\nsena-mukhas are called a Gulma; three gulmas, a Gana; three ganas, a\\nVahini; three vahinis together are called a Pritana; three pritanas form\\na Chamu; three chamus, one Anikini; and an anikini taken ten times forms,\\nas it is styled by those who know, an Akshauhini. O ye best of Brahmanas,\\narithmeticians have calculated that the number of chariots in an\\nAkshauhini is twenty-one thousand eight hundred and seventy. The measure\\nof elephants must be fixed at the same number. O ye pure, you must know\\nthat the number of foot-soldiers is one hundred and nine thousand, three\\nhundred and fifty, the number of horse is sixty-five thousand, six\\nhundred and ten. These, O Brahmanas, as fully explained by me, are the\\nnumbers of an Akshauhini as said by those acquainted with the principles\\nof numbers. O best of Brahmanas, according to this calculation were\\ncomposed the eighteen Akshauhinis of the Kaurava and the Pandava army.\\nTime, whose acts are wonderful assembled them on that spot and having\\nmade the Kauravas the cause, destroyed them all. Bhishma acquainted with\\nchoice of weapons, fought for ten days. Drona protected the Kaurava\\nVahinis for five days. Kama the desolator of hostile armies fought for\\ntwo days; and Salya for half a day. After that lasted for half a day the\\nencounter with clubs between Duryodhana and Bhima. At the close of that\\nday, Aswatthaman and Kripa destroyed the army of Yudishthira in the night\\nwhile sleeping without suspicion of danger.\\n\\n\\'O Saunaka, this best of narrations called Bharata which has begun to be\\nrepeated at thy sacrifice, was formerly repeated at the sacrifice of\\nJanamejaya by an intelligent disciple of Vyasa. It is divided into\\nseveral sections; in the beginning are Paushya, Pauloma, and Astika\\nparvas, describing in full the valour and renown of kings. It is a work\\nwhose description, diction, and sense are varied and wonderful. It\\ncontains an account of various manners and rites. It is accepted by the\\nwise, as the state called Vairagya is by men desirous of final release.\\nAs Self among things to be known, as life among things that are dear, so\\nis this history that furnisheth the means of arriving at the knowledge of\\nBrahma the first among all the sastras. There is not a story current in\\nthis world but doth depend upon this history even as the body upon the\\nfoot that it taketh. As masters of good lineage are ever attended upon by\\nservants desirous of preferment so is the Bharata cherished by all poets.\\nAs the words constituting the several branches of knowledge appertaining\\nto the world and the Veda display only vowels and consonants, so this\\nexcellent history displayeth only the highest wisdom.\\n\\n\\'Listen, O ye ascetics, to the outlines of the several divisions (parvas)\\nof this history called Bharata, endued with great wisdom, of sections and\\nfeet that are wonderful and various, of subtile meanings and logical\\nconnections, and embellished with the substance of the Vedas.\\n\\n\\'The first parva is called Anukramanika; the second, Sangraha; then\\nPaushya; then Pauloma; the Astika; then Adivansavatarana. Then comes the\\nSambhava of wonderful and thrilling incidents. Then comes Jatugrihadaha\\n(setting fire to the house of lac) and then Hidimbabadha (the killing of\\nHidimba) parvas; then comes Baka-badha (slaughter of Baka) and then\\nChitraratha. The next is called Swayamvara (selection of husband by\\nPanchali), in which Arjuna by the exercise of Kshatriya virtues, won\\nDraupadi for wife. Then comes Vaivahika (marriage). Then comes\\nViduragamana (advent of Vidura), Rajyalabha (acquirement of kingdom),\\nArjuna-banavasa (exile of Arjuna) and Subhadra-harana (the carrying away\\nof Subhadra). After these come Harana-harika, Khandava-daha (the burning\\nof the Khandava forest) and Maya-darsana (meeting with Maya the Asura\\narchitect). Then come Sabha, Mantra, Jarasandha, Digvijaya (general\\ncampaign). After Digvijaya come Raja-suyaka, Arghyaviharana (the robbing\\nof the Arghya) and Sisupala-badha (the killing of Sisupala). After these,\\nDyuta (gambling), Anudyuta (subsequent to gambling), Aranyaka, and\\nKrimira-badha (destruction of Krimira). The Arjuna-vigamana (the travels\\nof Arjuna), Kairati.

Then is narrated the receipt of this intelligence by Bhima from the\\nfowlers: then is narrated how, moved by the insulting speeches of the\\nintelligent Yudhishthira, Duryodhana ever unable to bear affronts, came\\nout of the waters. Then comes the encounter with clubs, between\\nDuryodhana and Bhima; then the arrival, at the time of such encounter, of\\nBalarama: then is described the sacredness of the Saraswati; then the\\nprogress of the encounter with clubs; then the fracture of Duryodhana\\'s\\nthighs in battle by Bhima with (a terrific hurl of) his mace. These all\\nhave been described in the wonderful ninth Parva. In this the number of\\nsections is fifty-nine and the number of slokas composed by the great\\nVyasa--the spreader of the fame of the Kauravas--is three thousand, two\\nhundred and twenty.\\n\\n\"Then shall I describe the Parva called Sauptika of frightful incidents.\\nOn the Pandavas having gone away, the mighty charioteers, Kritavarman,\\nKripa, and the son of Drona, came to the field of battle in the evening\\nand there saw king Duryodhana lying on the ground, his thighs broken, and\\nhimself covered with blood. Then the great charioteer, the son of Drona,\\nof terrible wrath, vowed, \\'without killing all the Panchalas including\\nDrishtadyumna, and the Pandavas also with all their allies, I will not\\ntake off armour.\\' Having spoken those words, the three warriors leaving\\nDuryodhana\\'s side entered the great forest just as the sun was setting.\\nWhile sitting under a large banian tree in the night, they saw an owl\\nkilling numerous crows one after another. At the sight of this,\\nAswatthaman, his heart full of rage at the thought of his father\\'s fate,\\nresolved to slay the slumbering Panchalas. And wending to the gate of the\\ncamp, he saw there a Rakshasa of frightful visage, his head reaching to\\nthe very heavens, guarding the entrance. And seeing that Rakshasa\\nobstructing all his weapons, the son of Drona speedily pacified by\\nworship the three-eyed Rudra. And then accompanied by Kritavarman and\\nKripa he slew all the sons of Draupadi, all the Panchalas with\\nDhrishtadyumna and others, together with their relatives, slumbering\\nunsuspectingly in the night. All perished on that fatal night except the\\nfive Pandavas and the great warrior Satyaki. Those escaped owing to\\nKrishna\\'s counsels, then the charioteer of Dhrishtadyumna brought to the\\nPandavas intelligence of the slaughter of the slumbering Panchalas by the\\nson of Drona. Then Draupadi distressed at the death of her sons and\\nbrothers and father sat before her lords resolved to kill herself by\\nfasting. Then Bhima of terrible prowess, moved by the words of Draupadi,\\nresolved, to please her; and speedily taking up his mace followed in\\nwrath the son of his preceptor in arms. The son of Drona from fear of\\nBhimasena and impelled by the fates and moved also by anger discharged a\\ncelestial weapon saying, \\'This is for the destruction of all the\\nPandavas\\'; then Krishna saying. \\'This shall not be\\', neutralised\\nAswatthaman\\'s speech. Then Arjuna neutralised that weapon by one of his\\nown. Seeing the wicked Aswatthaman\\'s destructive intentions, Dwaipayana\\nand Krishna pronounced curses on him which the latter returned. Pandava\\nthen deprived the mighty warrior-in-chariot Aswatthaman, of the jewel on\\nhis head, and became exceedingly glad, and, boastful of their success,\\nmade a present of it to the sorrowing Draupadi. Thus the tenth Parva,\\ncalled Sauptika, is recited. The great Vyasa hath composed this in\\neighteen sections. The number of slokas also composed (in this) by the\\ngreat reciter of sacred truths is eight hundred and seventy. In this\\nParva has been put together by the great Rishi the two Parvas called\\nSauptika and Aishika.\\n\\n\"After this hath been recited the highly pathetic Parva called Stri,\\nDhritarashtra of prophetic eye, afflicted at the death of his children,\\nand moved by enmity towards Bhima, broke into pieces a statue of hard\\niron deftly placed before him by Krishna (as substitute of Bhima). Then\\nVidura, removing the distressed Dhritarashtra\\'s affection for worldly\\nthings by reasons pointing to final release, consoled that wise monarch.\\nThen hath been described the wending of the distressed Dhritarashtra\\naccompanied by the ladies of his house to the field of battle of the\\nKauravas. Here follow the pathetic wailings of the wives of the slain\\nheroes. Then the wrath of Gandhari and Dhritarashtra and their loss of\\nconsciousness. Then the Kshatriya ladies saw those heroes,--their\\nunreturning sons, brothers, and fathers,--lying dead on the field. Then\\nthe pacification by Krishna of the wrath of Gandhari distressed at the\\ndeath of her sons and grandsons. Then the cremation of the bodies of the\\ndeceased Rajas with due rites by that monarch (Yudhishthira) of great\\nwisdom and the foremost also of all virtuous men. Then upon the\\npresentation of water of the manes of the deceased princes having\\ncommenced, the story of Kunti\\'s acknowledgment of Karna as her son born\\nin secret. Those have all been described by the great Rishi Vyasa in the\\nhighly pathetic eleventh Parva. Its perusal moveth every feeling heart\\nwith sorrow and even draweth tears from the eyes. The number of sections\\ncomposed is twenty-seven. The number of slokas is seven hundred and\\nseventy-five.\\n\\n\"Twelfth in number cometh the Santi Parva, which increaseth the\\nunderstanding and in which is related the despondency of Yudhishthira on\\nhis having slain his fathers, brothers, sons, maternal uncles and\\nmatrimonial relations. In this Parva is described how from his bed of\\narrows Bhishma expounded various systems of duties worth the study of\\nkings desirous of knowledge; this Parva expounded the duties relative to\\nemergencies, with full indications of time and reasons. By understanding\\nthese, a person attaineth to consummate knowledge. The mysteries also of\\nfinal emancipation have been expatiated upon. This is the twelfth Parva\\nthe favourite of the wise. It consists of three hundred and thirty-nine\\nsections, and contains fourteen thousand, seven hundred and thirty-two\\nslokas.\\n\\n\"Next in order is the excellent Anusasana Parva. In it is described how\\nYudhishthira, the king of the Kurus, was reconciled to himself on hearing\\nthe exposition of duties by Bhishma, the son of Bhagirathi. This Parva\\ntreats of rules in detail and of Dharma and Artha; then the rules of\\ncharity and its merits; then the qualifications of donees, and the\\nsupreme ride-regarding gifts. This Parva also describes the ceremonials\\nof individual duty, the rules of conduct and the matchless merit of\\ntruth. This Parva showeth the great merit of Brahmanas and kine, and\\nunraveleth the mysteries of duties in relation to time and place. These\\nare embodied in the excellent Parva called Anusasana of varied incidents.\\nIn this hath been described the ascension of Bhishma to Heaven. This is\\nthe thirteenth Parva which hath laid down accurately the various duties\\nof men. The number of sections, in this is one hundred and forty-six. The\\nnumber of slokas is eight thousand.\\n\\n\"Then comes the fourteenth Parva Aswamedhika. In this is the excellent\\nstory of Samvarta and Marutta. Then is described the discovery (by the\\nPandavas) of golden treasuries; and then the birth of Parikshit who was\\nrevived by Krishna after having been burnt by the (celestial) weapon of\\nAswatthaman. The battles of Arjuna the son of Pandu, while following the\\nsacrificial horse let loose, with various princes who in wrath seized it.\\nThen is shown the great risk of Arjuna in his encounter with Vabhruvahana\\nthe son of Chitrangada (by Arjuna) the appointed daughter of the chief of\\nManipura. Then the story of the mongoose during the performance of the\\nhorse-sacrifice. This is the most wonderful Parva called Aswamedhika. The\\nnumber of sections is one hundred and three. The number of slokas\\ncomposed (in this) by Vyasa of true knowledge is three thousand, three\\nhundred and twenty.\\n\\n\"Then comes the fifteenth Parva called Asramvasika. In this,\\nDhritarashtra, abdicating the kingdom, and accompanied by Gandhari and\\nVidura went to the woods. Seeing this, the virtuous Pritha also, ever\\nengaged in cherishing her superiors, leaving the court of her sons,\\nfollowed the old couple. In this is described the wonderful meeting\\nthrough the kindness of Vyasa of the king (Dhritarashtra) with the\\nspirits of his slain children, grand-children, and other princes,\\nreturned from the other world. Then the monarch abandoning his sorrows\\nacquired with his wife the highest fruit of his meritorious actions. In\\nthis Parva, Vidura after having leaned on virtue all his life attaineth\\nto the most meritorious state.\\n\\n\"The learned son of Gavalgana, Sanjaya, also of passions under full\\ncontrol, and the foremost of ministers, attained, in the Parva, to the\\nblessed state. In this, Yudhishthira the just met Narada and heard from\\nhim about the extinction of the race of Vrishnis. This is the very\\nwonderful Parva called Asramvasika. The number of sections in this is\\nforty-two, and the number of slokas composed by Vyasa cognisant of truth\\nis one thousand five hundred and six.\\n\\n\"After this, you know, comes the Maushala of painful incidents. In this,\\nthose lion-hearted heroes (of the race of Vrishni) with the scars of many\\na field on their bodies, oppressed with the curse of a Brahmana, while\\ndeprived of reason from drink, impelled by the fates, slew each other on\\nthe shores of the Salt Sea with the Eraka grass which (in their hands)\\nbecame (invested with the fatal attributes of the) thunder. In this, both\\nBalarama and Kesava (Krishna) after causing the extermination of their\\nrace, their hour having come, themselves did not rise superior to the\\nsway of all-destroying Time. In this, Arjuna the foremost among men,\\ngoing to Dwaravati (Dwaraka) and seeing the city destitute of the\\nVrishnis was much affected and became exceedingly sorry. Then after the\\nfuneral of his maternal uncle Vasudeva the foremost among the Yadus\\n(Vrishnis), he saw the heroes of the Yadu race lying stretched in death\\non the spot where they had been drinking. He then caused the cremation of\\nthe bodies of the illustrious Krishna and Balarama and of the principal\\nmembers of the Vrishni race. Then as he was journeying from Dwaraka with\\nthe women and children, the old and the decrepit--the remnants of the\\nYadu race--he was met on the way by a heavy calamity. He witnessed also\\nthe disgrace of his bow Gandiva and the unpropitiousness of his celestial\\nweapons. Seeing all this, Arjuna became despondent and, pursuant to\\nVyasa\\'s advice, went to Yudhishthira and solicited permission to adopt\\nthe Sannyasa mode of life. This is the sixteenth Parva called Maushala\\nThe number of sections is eight and the number of slokas composed by\\nVyasa cognisant of truth is three hundred and twenty.\\n\\n\"The next is Mahaprasthanika, the seventeenth Parva.\\n\\n\"In this, those foremost among men the Pandavas abdicating their kingdom\\nwent with Draupadi on their great journey called Mahaprasthana. In this,\\nthey came across Agni, having arrived on the shore of the sea of red\\nwaters. In this, asked by Agni himself, Arjuna worshipped him duly,\\nreturned to him the excellent celestial bow called Gandiva. In this,\\nleaving his brothers who dropped one after another and Draupadi also,\\nYudhishthira went on his journey without once looking back on them. This\\nthe seventeenth Parva is called Mahaprasthanika. The number of sections\\nin this is three. The number of slokas also composed by Vyasa cognisant\\nof truth is three hundred and twenty.\\n\\n\"The Parva that comes after this, you must know, is the extraordinary one\\ncalled Svarga of celestial incidents. Then seeing the celestial car come\\nto take him, Yudhishthira moved by kindness towards the dog that\\naccompanied him, refused to ascend it without his companion. Observing\\nthe illustrious Yudhishthira\\'s steady adherence to virtue, Dharma (the\\ngod of justice) abandoning his canine form showed himself to the king.\\nThen Yudhishthira ascending to heaven felt much pain. The celestial\\nmessenger showed him hell by an act of deception. Then Yudhishthira, the\\nsoul of justice, heard the heart-rending lamentations of his brothers\\nabiding in that region under the discipline of Yama. Then Dharma and\\nIndra showed Yudhishthira the region appointed for sinners. Then\\nYudhishthira, after leaving the human body by a plunge in the celestial\\nGanges, attained to that region which his acts merited, and began to live\\nin joy respected by Indra and all other gods. This is the eighteenth\\nParva as narrated by the illustrious Vyasa. The number of slokas\\ncomposed, O ascetics, by the great Rishi in this is two hundred and nine.\\n\\n\"The above are the contents of the Eighteen Parvas. In the appendix\\n(Khita) are the Harivansa and the Vavishya. The number of slokas\\ncontained in the Harivansa is twelve thousand.\"\\n\\nThese are the contents of the section called Parva-sangraha. Sauti\\ncontinued, \"Eighteen Akshauhinis of troops came together for battle. The\\nencounter that ensued was terrible and lasted for eighteen days. He who\\nknows the four Vedas with all the Angas and Upanishads, but does not know\\nthis history (Bharata), cannot be regarded as wise. Vyasa of immeasurable\\nintelligence, has spoken of the Mahabharata as a treatise on Artha, on\\nDharma, and on Kama. Those who have listened to his history can never\\nbear to listen to others, as, indeed, they who have listened to the sweet\\nvoice of the male Kokila can never hear the dissonance of the crow\\'s\\ncawing. As the formation of the three worlds proceedeth from the five\\nelements, so do the inspirations of all poets proceed from this excellent\\ncomposition. O ye Brahman, as the four kinds of creatures (viviparous,\\noviparous, born of hot moisture and vegetables) are dependent on space\\nfor their existence, so the Puranas depend upon this history. As all the\\nsenses depend for their exercise upon the various modifications of the\\nmind, so do all acts (ceremonials) and moral qualities depend upon this\\ntreatise. There is not a story current in the world but doth depend on\\nthis history, even as body upon the food it taketh. All poets cherish the\\nBharata even as servants desirous of preferment always attend upon\\nmasters of good lineage. Even as the blessed domestic Asrama can never be\\nsurpassed by the three other Asramas (modes of life) so no poets can\\nsurpass this poem.\\n\\n\"Ye ascetics, shake off all inaction. Let your hearts be fixed on virtue,\\nfor virtue is the one only friend of him that has gone to the other\\nworld. Even the most intelligent by cherishing wealth and wives can never\\nmake these their own, nor are these possessions lasting. The Bharata\\nuttered by the lips of Dwaipayana is without a parallel; it is virtue\\nitself and sacred. It destroyeth sin and produceth good. He that\\nlisteneth to it while it is being recited hath no need of a bath in the\\nsacred waters of Pushkara. A Brahmana, whatever sins he may commit during\\nthe day through his senses, is freed from them all by reading the Bharata\\nin the evening. Whatever sins he may commit also in the night by deeds,\\nwords, or mind, he is freed from them all by reading Bharata in the first\\ntwilight (morning). He that giveth a hundred kine with horns mounted with\\ngold to a Brahmana well-posted up in the Vedas and all branches of\\nlearning, and he that daily listeneth to the sacred narrations of the\\nBharata, acquireth equal merit. As the wide ocean is easily passable by\\nmen having ships, so is this extensive history of great excellence and\\ndeep import with the help of this chapter called Parva sangraha.\"\\n\\nThus endeth the section called Parva-sangraha of the Adi Parva of the\\nblessed Mahabharata.\\n\\n\\n\\n'"

       "' I\\n\\nOm! Having bowed down to Narayana and Nara, the most exalted male being,\\nand also to the goddess Saraswati, must the word Jaya be uttered.\\n\\nUgrasrava, the son of Lomaharshana, surnamed Sauti, well-versed in the\\nPuranas, bending with humility, one day approached the great sages of\\nrigid vows, sitting at their ease, who had attended the twelve years\\'\\nsacrifice of Saunaka, surnamed Kulapati, in the forest of Naimisha. Those\\nascetics, wishing to hear his wonderful narrations, presently began to\\naddress him who had thus arrived at that recluse abode of the inhabitants\\nof the forest of Naimisha. Having been entertained with due respect by\\nthose holy men, he saluted those Munis (sages) with joined palms, even\\nall of them, and inquired about the progress of their asceticism. Then\\nall the ascetics being again seated, the son of Lomaharshana humbly\\noccupied the seat that was assigned to him. Seeing that he was\\ncomfortably seated, and recovered from fatigue, one of the Rishis\\nbeginning the conversation, asked him, \\'Whence comest thou, O lotus-eyed\\nSauti, and where hast thou spent the time? Tell me, who ask thee, in\\ndetail.\\'\\n\\nAccomplished in speech, Sauti, thus questioned, gave in the midst of that\\nbig assemblage of contemplative Munis a full and proper answer in words\\nconsonant with their mode of life.\\n\\n\"Sauti said, \\'Having heard the diverse sacred and wonderful stories which\\nwere composed in his Mahabharata by Krishna-Dwaipayana, and which were\\nrecited in full by Vaisampayana at the Snake-sacrifice of the high-souled\\nroyal sage Janamejaya and in the presence also of that chief of Princes,\\nthe son of Parikshit, and having wandered about, visiting many sacred\\nwaters and holy shrines, I journeyed to the country venerated by the\\nDwijas (twice-born) and called Samantapanchaka where formerly was fought\\nthe battle between the children of Kuru and Pandu, and all the chiefs of\\nthe land ranged on either side. Thence, anxious to see you, I am come\\ninto your presence. Ye reverend sages, all of whom are to me as Brahma;\\nye greatly blessed who shine in this place of sacrifice with the\\nsplendour of the solar fire: ye who have concluded the silent meditations\\nand have fed the holy fire; and yet who are sitting--without care, what,\\nO ye Dwijas (twice-born), shall I repeat, shall I recount the sacred\\nstories collected in the Puranas containing precepts of religious duty\\nand of worldly profit, or the acts of illustrious saints and sovereigns\\nof mankind?\"\\n\\n\"The Rishi replied, \\'The Purana, first promulgated by the great Rishi\\nDwaipayana, and which after having been heard both by the gods and the\\nBrahmarshis was highly esteemed, being the most eminent narrative that\\nexists, diversified both in diction and division, possessing subtile\\nmeanings logically combined, and gleaned from the Vedas, is a sacred\\nwork. Composed in elegant language, it includeth the subjects of other\\nbooks. It is elucidated by other Shastras, and comprehendeth the sense of\\nthe four Vedas. We are desirous of hearing that history also called\\nBharata, the holy composition of the wonderful Vyasa, which dispelleth\\nthe fear of evil, just as it was cheerfully recited by the Rishi\\nVaisampayana, under the direction of Dwaipayana himself, at the\\nsnake-sacrifice of Raja Janamejaya?\\'\\n\\n\"Sauti then said, \\'Having bowed down to the primordial being Isana, to\\nwhom multitudes make offerings, and who is adored by the multitude; who\\nis the true incorruptible one, Brahma, perceptible, imperceptible,\\neternal; who is both a non-existing and an existing-non-existing being;\\nwho is the universe and also distinct from the existing and non-existing\\nuniverse; who is the creator of high and low; the ancient, exalted,\\ninexhaustible one; who is Vishnu, beneficent and the beneficence itself,\\nworthy of all preference, pure and immaculate; who is Hari, the ruler of\\nthe faculties, the guide of all things moveable and immoveable; I will\\ndeclare the sacred thoughts of the illustrious sage Vyasa, of marvellous\\ndeeds and worshipped here by all. Some bards have already published this\\nhistory, some are now teaching it, and others, in like manner, will\\nhereafter promulgate it upon the earth. It is a great source of\\nknowledge, established throughout the three regions of the world. It is\\npossessed by the twice-born both in detailed and compendious forms. It is\\nthe delight of the learned for being embellished with elegant\\nexpressions, conversations human and divine, and a variety of poetical\\nmeasures.\\n\\nIn this world, when it was destitute of brightness and light, and\\nenveloped all around in total darkness, there came into being, as the\\nprimal cause of creation, a mighty egg, the one inexhaustible seed of all\\ncreated beings. It is called Mahadivya, and was formed at the beginning\\nof the Yuga, in which we are told, was the true light Brahma, the eternal\\none, the wonderful and inconceivable being present alike in all places;\\nthe invisible and subtile cause, whose nature partaketh of entity and\\nnon-entity. From this egg came out the lord Pitamaha Brahma, the one only\\nPrajapati; with Suraguru and Sthanu. Then appeared the twenty-one\\nPrajapatis, viz., Manu, Vasishtha and Parameshthi; ten Prachetas, Daksha,\\nand the seven sons of Daksha. Then appeared the man of inconceivable\\nnature whom all the Rishis know and so the Viswe-devas, the Adityas, the\\nVasus, and the twin Aswins; the Yakshas, the Sadhyas, the Pisachas, the\\nGuhyakas, and the Pitris. After these were produced the wise and most\\nholy Brahmarshis, and the numerous Rajarshis distinguished by every noble\\nquality. So the water, the heavens, the earth, the air, the sky, the\\npoints of the heavens, the years, the seasons, the months, the\\nfortnights, called Pakshas, with day and night in due succession. And\\nthus were produced all things which are known to mankind.\\n\\nAnd what is seen in the universe, whether animate or inanimate, of\\ncreated things, will at the end of the world, and after the expiration of\\nthe Yuga, be again confounded. And, at the commencement of other Yugas,\\nall things will be renovated, and, like the various fruits of the earth,\\nsucceed each other in the due order of their seasons. Thus continueth\\nperpetually to revolve in the world, without beginning and without end,\\nthis wheel which causeth the destruction of all things.\\n\\nThe generation of Devas, in brief, was thirty-three thousand,\\nthirty-three hundred and thirty-three. The sons of Div were Brihadbhanu,\\nChakshus, Atma Vibhavasu, Savita, Richika, Arka, Bhanu, Asavaha, and\\nRavi. Of these Vivaswans of old, Mahya was the youngest whose son was\\nDeva-vrata. The latter had for his son, Su-vrata who, we learn, had three\\nsons,--Dasa-jyoti, Sata-jyoti, and Sahasra-jyoti, each of them producing\\nnumerous offspring. The illustrious Dasa-jyoti had ten thousand,\\nSata-jyoti ten times that number, and Sahasra-jyoti ten times the number\\nof Sata-jyoti\\'s offspring. From these are descended the family of the\\nKurus, of the Yadus, and of Bharata; the family of Yayati and of\\nIkshwaku; also of all the Rajarshis. Numerous also were the generations\\nproduced, and very abundant were the creatures and their places of abode.\\nThe mystery which is threefold--the Vedas, Yoga, and Vijnana Dharma,\\nArtha, and Kama--also various books upon the subject of Dharma, Artha,\\nand Kama; also rules for the conduct of mankind; also histories and\\ndiscourses with various srutis; all of which having been seen by the\\nRishi Vyasa are here in due order mentioned as a specimen of the book.\\n\\nThe Rishi Vyasa published this mass of knowledge in both a detailed and\\nan abridged form. It is the wish of the learned in the world to possess\\nthe details and the abridgement. Some read the Bharata beginning with the\\ninitial mantra (invocation), others with the story of Astika, others with\\nUparichara, while some Brahmanas study the whole. Men of learning display\\ntheir various knowledge of the institutes in commenting on the\\ncomposition. Some are skilful in explaining it, while others, in\\nremembering its contents.\\n\\nThe son of Satyavati having, by penance and meditation, analysed the\\neternal Veda, afterwards composed this holy history, when that learned\\nBrahmarshi of strict vows, the noble Dwaipayana Vyasa, offspring of\\nParasara, had finished this greatest of narrations, he began to consider\\nhow he might teach it to his disciples. And the possessor of the six\\nattributes, Brahma, the world\\'s preceptor, knowing of the anxiety of the\\nRishi Dwaipayana, came in person to the place where the latter was, for\\ngratifying the saint, and benefiting the people. And when Vyasa,\\nsurrounded by all the tribes of Munis, saw him, he was surprised; and,\\nstanding with joined palms, he bowed and ordered a seat to be brought.\\nAnd Vyasa having gone round him who is called Hiranyagarbha seated on\\nthat distinguished seat stood near it; and being commanded by Brahma\\nParameshthi, he sat down near the seat, full of affection and smiling in\\njoy. Then the greatly glorious Vyasa, addressing Brahma Parameshthi,\\nsaid, \"O divine Brahma, by me a poem hath been composed which is greatly\\nrespected. The mystery of the Veda, and what other subjects have been\\nexplained by me; the various rituals of the Upanishads with the Angas;\\nthe compilation of the Puranas and history formed by me and named after\\nthe three divisions of time, past, present, and future; the determination\\nof the nature of decay, fear, disease, existence, and non-existence, a\\ndescription of creeds and of the various modes of life; rule for the four\\ncastes, and the import of all the Puranas; an account of asceticism and\\nof the duties of a religious student; the dimensions of the sun and moon,\\nthe planets, constellations, and stars, together with the duration of the\\nfour ages; the Rik, Sama and Yajur Vedas; also the Adhyatma; the sciences\\ncalled Nyaya, Orthoephy and Treatment of diseases; charity and\\nPasupatadharma; birth celestial and human, for particular purposes; also\\na description of places of pilgrimage and other holy places of rivers,\\nmountains, forests, the ocean, of heavenly cities and the kalpas; the art\\nof war; the different kinds of nations and languages: the nature of the\\nmanners of the people; and the all-pervading spirit;--all these have been\\nrepresented. But, after all, no writer of this work is to be found on\\nearth.\\'\\n\\n\"Brahma said. \\'I esteem thee for thy knowledge of divine mysteries,\\nbefore the whole body of celebrated Munis distinguished for the sanctity\\nof their lives. I know thou hast revealed the divine word, even from its\\nfirst utterance, in the language of truth. Thou hast called thy present\\nwork a poem, wherefore it shall be a poem. There shall be no poets whose\\nworks may equal the descriptions of this poem, even, as the three other\\nmodes called Asrama are ever unequal in merit to the domestic Asrama. Let\\nGanesa be thought of, O Muni, for the purpose of writing the poem.\\'\\n\\n\"Sauti said, \\'Brahma having thus spoken to Vyasa, retired to his own\\nabode. Then Vyasa began to call to mind Ganesa. And Ganesa, obviator of\\nobstacles, ready to fulfil the desires of his votaries, was no sooner\\nthought of, than he repaired to the place where Vyasa was seated. And\\nwhen he had been saluted, and was seated, Vyasa addressed him thus, \\'O\\nguide of the Ganas! be thou the writer of the Bharata which I have formed\\nin my imagination, and which I am about to repeat.\"\\n\\n\"Ganesa, upon hearing this address, thus answered, \\'I will become the\\nwriter of thy work, provided my pen do not for a moment cease writing.\"\\nAnd Vyasa said unto that divinity, \\'Wherever there be anything thou dost\\nnot comprehend, cease to continue writing.\\' Ganesa having signified his\\nassent, by repeating the word Om! proceeded to write; and Vyasa began;\\nand by way of diversion, he knit the knots of composition exceeding\\nclose; by doing which, he dictated this work according to his engagement.\\n\\nI am (continued Sauti) acquainted with eight thousand and eight hundred\\nverses, and so is Suka, and perhaps Sanjaya. From the mysteriousness of\\ntheir meaning, O Muni, no one is able, to this day, to penetrate those\\nclosely knit difficult slokas. Even the omniscient Ganesa took a moment\\nto consider; while Vyasa, however, continued to compose other verses in\\ngreat abundance.\\n\\nThe wisdom of this work, like unto an instrument of applying collyrium,\\nhath opened the eyes of the inquisitive world blinded by the darkness of\\nignorance. As the sun dispelleth the darkness, so doth the Bharata by its\\ndiscourses on religion, profit, pleasure and final release, dispel the\\nignorance of men. As the full-moon by its mild light expandeth the buds\\nof the water-lily, so this Purana, by exposing the light of the Sruti\\nhath expanded the human intellect. By the lamp of history, which\\ndestroyeth the darkness of ignorance, the whole mansion of nature is\\nproperly and completely illuminated.\\n\\nThis work is a tree, of which the chapter of contents is the seed; the\\ndivisions called Pauloma and Astika are the root; the part called\\nSambhava is the trunk; the books called Sabha and Aranya are the roosting\\nperches; the books called Arani is the knitting knots; the books called\\nVirata and Udyoga the pith; the book named Bhishma, the main branch; the\\nbook called Drona, the leaves; the book called Karna, the fair flowers;\\nthe book named Salya, their sweet smell; the books entitled Stri and\\nAishika, the refreshing shade; the book called Santi, the mighty fruit;\\nthe book called Aswamedha, the immortal sap; the denominated\\nAsramavasika, the spot where it groweth; and the book called Mausala, is\\nan epitome of the Vedas and held in great respect by the virtuous\\nBrahmanas. The tree of the Bharata, inexhaustible to mankind as the\\nclouds, shall be as a source of livelihood to all distinguished poets.\"\\n\\n\"Sauti continued, \\'I will now speak of the undying flowery and fruitful\\nproductions of this tree, possessed of pure and pleasant taste, and not\\nto be destroyed even by the immortals. Formerly, the spirited and\\nvirtuous Krishna-Dwaipayana, by the injunctions of Bhishma, the wise son\\nof Ganga and of his own mother, became the father of three boys who were\\nlike the three fires by the two wives of Vichitra-virya; and having thus\\nraised up Dhritarashtra, Pandu and Vidura, he returned to his recluse\\nabode to prosecute his religious exercise.\\n\\nIt was not till after these were born, grown up, and departed on the\\nsupreme journey, that the great Rishi Vyasa published the Bharata in this\\nregion of mankind; when being solicited by Janamejaya and thousands of\\nBrahmanas, he instructed his disciple Vaisampayana, who was seated near\\nhim; and he, sitting together with the Sadasyas, recited the Bharata,\\nduring the intervals of the ceremonies of the sacrifice, being repeatedly\\nurged to proceed.\\n\\nVyasa hath fully represented the greatness of the house of Kuru, the\\nvirtuous principles of Gandhari, the wisdom of Vidura, and the constancy\\nof Kunti. The noble Rishi hath also described the divinity of Vasudeva,\\nthe rectitude of the sons of Pandu, and the evil practices of the sons\\nand partisans of Dhritarashtra.\\n\\nVyasa executed the compilation of the Bharata, exclusive of the episodes\\noriginally in twenty-four thousand verses; and so much only is called by\\nthe learned as the Bharata. Afterwards, he composed an epitome in one\\nhundred and fifty verses, consisting of the introduction with the chapter\\nof contents. This he first taught to his son Suka; and afterwards he gave\\nit to others of his disciples who were possessed of the same\\nqualifications. After that he executed another compilation, consisting of\\nsix hundred thousand verses. Of those, thirty hundred thousand are known\\nin the world of the Devas; fifteen hundred thousand in the world of the\\nPitris: fourteen hundred thousand among the Gandharvas, and one hundred\\nthousand in the regions of mankind. Narada recited them to the Devas,\\nDevala to the Pitris, and Suka published them to the Gandharvas, Yakshas,\\nand Rakshasas: and in this world they were recited by Vaisampayana, one\\nof the disciples of Vyasa, a man of just principles and the first among\\nall those acquainted with the Vedas. Know that I, Sauti, have also\\nrepeated one hundred thousand verses.\\n\\nYudhishthira is a vast tree, formed of religion and virtue; Arjuna is its\\ntrunk; Bhimasena, its branches; the two sons of Madri are its full-grown\\nfruit and flowers; and its roots are Krishna, Brahma, and the Brahmanas.\\n\\nPandu, after having subdued many countries by his wisdom and prowess,\\ntook up his abode with the Munis in a certain forest as a sportsman,\\nwhere he brought upon himself a very severe misfortune for having killed\\na stag coupling with its mate, which served as a warning for the conduct\\nof the princes of his house as long as they lived. Their mothers, in\\norder that the ordinances of the law might be fulfilled, admitted as\\nsubstitutes to their embraces the gods Dharma, Vayu, Sakra, and the\\ndivinities the twin Aswins. And when their offspring grew up, under the\\ncare of their two mothers, in the society of ascetics, in the midst of\\nsacred groves and holy recluse-abodes of religious men, they were\\nconducted by Rishis into the presence of Dhritarashtra and his sons,\\nfollowing as students in the habit of Brahmacharis, having their hair\\ntied in knots on their heads. \\'These our pupils\\', said they, \\'are as your\\nsons, your brothers, and your friends; they are Pandavas.\\' Saying this,\\nthe Munis disappeared.\\n\\nWhen the Kauravas saw them introduced as the sons of Pandu, the\\ndistinguished class of citizens shouted exceedingly for joy. Some,\\nhowever, said, they were not the sons of Pandu; others said, they were;\\nwhile a few asked how they could be his offspring, seeing he had been so\\nlong dead. Still on all sides voices were heard crying, \\'They are on all\\naccounts welcome! Through divine Providence we behold the family of\\nPandu! Let their welcome be proclaimed!\\' As these acclamations ceased,\\nthe plaudits of invisible spirits, causing every point of the heavens to\\nresound, were tremendous. There were showers of sweet-scented flowers,\\nand the sound of shells and kettle-drums. Such were the wonders that\\nhappened on the arrival of the young princes. The joyful noise of all the\\ncitizens, in expression of their satisfaction on the occasion, was so\\ngreat that it reached the very heavens in magnifying plaudits.\\n\\nHaving studied the whole of the Vedas and sundry other shastras, the\\nPandavas resided there, respected by all and without apprehension from\\nany one.\\n\\nThe principal men were pleased with the purity of Yudhishthira, the\\ncourage of Arjuna, the submissive attention of Kunti to her superiors,\\nand the humility of the twins, Nakula and Sahadeva; and all the people\\nrejoiced in their heroic virtues.\\n\\nAfter a while, Arjuna obtained the virgin Krishna at the swayamvara, in\\nthe midst of a concourse of Rajas, by performing a very difficult feat of\\narchery. And from this time he became very much respected in this world\\namong all bowmen; and in fields of battle also, like the sun, he was hard\\nto behold by foe-men. And having vanquished all the neighbouring princes\\nand every considerable tribe, he accomplished all that was necessary for\\nthe Raja (his eldest brother) to perform the great sacrifice called\\nRajasuya.\\n\\nYudhishthira, after having, through the wise counsels of Vasudeva and by\\nthe valour of Bhimasena and Arjuna, slain Jarasandha (the king of\\nMagadha) and the proud Chaidya, acquired the right to perform the grand\\nsacrifice of Rajasuya abounding in provisions and offering and fraught\\nwith transcendent merits. And Duryodhana came to this sacrifice; and when\\nhe beheld the vast wealth of the Pandavas scattered all around, the\\nofferings, the precious stones, gold and jewels; the wealth in cows,\\nelephants, and horses; the curious textures, garments, and mantles; the\\nprecious shawls and furs and carpets made of the skin of the Ranku; he\\nwas filled with envy and became exceedingly displeased. And when he\\nbeheld the hall of assembly elegantly constructed by Maya (the Asura\\narchitect) after the fashion of a celestial court, he was inflamed with\\nrage. And having started in confusion at certain architectural deceptions\\nwithin this building, he was derided by Bhimasena in the presence of\\nVasudeva, like one of mean descent.\\n\\nAnd it was represented to Dhritarashtra that his son, while partaking of\\nvarious objects of enjoyment and diverse precious things, was becoming\\nmeagre, wan, and pale. And Dhritarashtra, some time after, out of\\naffection for his son, gave his consent to their playing (with the\\nPandavas) at dice. And Vasudeva coming to know of this, became\\nexceedingly wroth. And being dissatisfied, he did nothing to prevent the\\ndisputes, but overlooked the gaming and sundry other horried\\nunjustifiable transactions arising therefrom: and in spite of Vidura,\\nBhishma, Drona, and Kripa, the son of Saradwan, he made the Kshatriyas\\nkill each other in the terrific war that ensued.\\'\\n\\n\"And Dhritarashtra hearing the ill news of the success of the Pandavas\\nand recollecting the resolutions of Duryodhana, Kama, and Sakuni,\\npondered for a while and addressed to Sanjaya the following speech:--\\n\\n\\'Attend, O Sanjaya, to all I am about to say, and it will not become thee\\nto treat me with contempt. Thou art well-versed in the shastras,\\nintelligent and endowed with wisdom. My inclination was never to war, not\\ndid I delight in the destruction of my race. I made no distinction\\nbetween my own children and the children of Pandu. My own sons were prone\\nto wilfulness and despised me because I am old. Blind as I am, because of\\nmy miserable plight and through paternal affection, I bore it all. I was\\nfoolish alter the thoughtless Duryodhana ever growing in folly. Having\\nbeen a spectator of the riches of the mighty sons of Pandu, my son was\\nderided for his awkwardness while ascending the hall. Unable to bear it\\nall and unable himself to overcome the sons of Pandu in the field, and\\nthough a soldier, unwilling yet to obtain good fortune by his own\\nexertion, with the help of the king of Gandhara he concerted an unfair\\ngame at dice.\\n\\n\\'Hear, O Sanjaya, all that happened thereupon and came to my knowledge.\\nAnd when thou hast heard all I say, recollecting everything as it fell\\nout, thou shall then know me for one with a prophetic eye. When I heard\\nthat Arjuna, having bent the bow, had pierced the curious mark and\\nbrought it down to the ground, and bore away in triumph the maiden\\nKrishna, in the sight of the assembled princes, then, O Sanjaya I had no\\nhope of success. When I heard that Subhadra of the race of Madhu had,\\nafter forcible seizure been married by Arjuna in the city of Dwaraka, and\\nthat the two heroes of the race of Vrishni (Krishna and Balarama the\\nbrothers of Subhadra) without resenting it had entered Indraprastha as\\nfriends, then, O Sanjaya, I had no hope of success. When I heard that\\nArjuna, by his celestial arrow preventing the downpour by Indra the king\\nof the gods, had gratified Agni by making over to him the forest of\\nKhandava, then, O Sanjaya, I had no hope of success. When I heard that\\nthe five Pandavas with their mother Kunti had escaped from the house of\\nlac, and that Vidura was engaged in the accomplishment of their designs,\\nthen, O Sanjaya, I had no hope of success. When I heard that Arjuna,\\nafter having pierced the mark in the arena had won Draupadi, and that the\\nbrave Panchalas had joined the Pandavas, then, O Sanjaya, I had no hope\\nof success. When I heard that Jarasandha, the foremost of the royal line\\nof Magadha, and blazing in the midst of the Kshatriyas, had been slain by\\nBhima with his bare arms alone, then, O Sanjaya, I had no hope of\\nsuccess. When I heard that in their general campaign the sons of Pandu\\nhad conquered the chiefs of the land and performed the grand sacrifice of\\nthe Rajasuya, then, O Sanjaya, I had no hope of success. When I heard\\nthat Draupadi, her voice choked with tears and heart full of agony, in\\nthe season of impurity and with but one raiment on, had been dragged into\\ncourt and though she had protectors, she had been treated as if she had\\nnone, then, O Sanjaya, I had no hope of success. When I heard that the\\nwicked wretch Duhsasana, was striving to strip her of that single\\ngarment, had only drawn from her person a large heap of cloth without\\nbeing able to arrive at its end, then, O Sanjaya, I had no hope of\\nsuccess. When I heard that Yudhishthira, beaten by Saubala at the game of\\ndice and deprived of his kingdom as a consequence thereof, had still been\\nattended upon by his brothers of incomparable prowess, then, O Sanjaya, I\\nhad no hope of success. When I heard that the virtuous Pandavas weeping\\nwith affliction had followed their elder brother to the wilderness and\\nexerted themselves variously for the mitigation of his discomforts, then,\\nO Sanjaya, I had no hope of success.\\n\\n\\'When I heard that Yudhishthira had been followed into the wilderness by\\nSnatakas and noble-minded Brahmanas who live upon alms, then, O Sanjaya,\\nI had no hope of success. When I heard that Arjuna, having, in combat,\\npleased the god of gods, Tryambaka (the three-eyed) in the disguise of a\\nhunter, obtained the great weapon Pasupata, then O Sanjaya, I had no hope\\nof success. When I heard that the just and renowned Arjuna after having\\nbeen to the celestial regions, had there obtained celestial weapons from\\nIndra himself then, O Sanjaya, I had no hope of success. When I heard\\nthat afterwards Arjuna had vanquished the Kalakeyas and the Paulomas\\nproud with the boon they had obtained and which had rendered them\\ninvulnerable even to the celestials, then, O Sanjaya, I had no hope of\\nsuccess. When I heard that Arjuna, the chastiser of enemies, having gone\\nto the regions of Indra for the destruction of the Asuras, had returned\\nthence successful, then, O Sanjaya, I had no hope of success. When I\\nheard that Bhima and the other sons of Pritha (Kunti) accompanied by\\nVaisravana had arrived at that country which is inaccessible to man then,\\nO Sanjaya, I had no hope of success.

When I heard that upon the horses of Arjuna being fatigued,\\nVasudeva releasing them made them drink water and bringing them back and\\nreharnessing them continued to guide them as before, then, O Sanjaya, I\\nhad no hope of success. When I heard that while his horses were fatigued,\\nArjuna staying in his chariot checked all his assailants, then, O\\nSanjaya, I had no hope of success.

Gandhari, destitute of children, grand-children, parents,\\nbrothers, and kindred, is to be pitied. Difficult is the task that hath\\nbeen performed by the Pandavas: by them hath a kingdom been recovered\\nwithout a rival.\\n\\n\\'Alas! I have heard that the war hath left only ten alive: three of our\\nside, and the Pandavas, seven, in that dreadful conflict eighteen\\nAkshauhinis of Kshatriyas have been slain! All around me is utter\\ndarkness, and a fit of swoon assaileth me: consciousness leaves me, O\\nSuta, and my mind is distracted.\"\\n\\n\"Sauti said, \\'Dhritarashtra, bewailing his fate in these words, was\\novercome with extreme anguish and for a time deprived of sense; but being\\nrevived, he addressed Sanjaya in the following words.\\n\\n\"After what hath come to pass, O Sanjaya, I wish to put an end to my life\\nwithout delay; I do not find the least advantage in cherishing it any\\nlonger.\"\\n\\n\"Sauti said, \\'The wise son of Gavalgana (Sanjaya) then addressed the\\ndistressed lord of Earth while thus talking and bewailing, sighing like a\\nserpent and repeatedly tainting, in words of deep import.\\n\\n\"Thou hast heard, O Raja, of the greatly powerful men of vast exertions,\\nspoken of by Vyasa and the wise Narada; men born of great royal families,\\nresplendent with worthy qualities, versed in the science of celestial\\narms, and in glory emblems of Indra; men who having conquered the world\\nby justice and performed sacrifices with fit offerings (to the\\nBrahmanas), obtained renown in this world and at last succumbed to the\\nsway of time. Such were Saivya; the valiant Maharatha; Srinjaya, great\\namongst conquerors. Suhotra; Rantideva, and Kakshivanta, great in glory;\\nValhika, Damana, Saryati, Ajita, and Nala; Viswamitra the destroyer of\\nfoes; Amvarisha, great in strength; Marutta, Manu, Ikshaku, Gaya, and\\nBharata; Rama the son of Dasaratha; Sasavindu, and Bhagiratha;\\nKritavirya, the greatly fortunate, and Janamejaya too; and Yayati of good\\ndeeds who performed sacrifices, being assisted therein by the celestials\\nthemselves, and by whose sacrificial altars and stakes this earth with\\nher habited and uninhabited regions hath been marked all over. These\\ntwenty-four Rajas were formerly spoken of by the celestial Rishi Narada\\nunto Saivya when much afflicted for the loss of his children. Besides\\nthese, other Rajas had gone before, still more powerful than they, mighty\\ncharioteers noble in mind, and resplendent with every worthy quality.\\nThese were Puru, Kuru, Yadu, Sura and Viswasrawa of great glory; Anuha,\\nYuvanaswu, Kakutstha, Vikrami, and Raghu; Vijava, Virihorta, Anga, Bhava,\\nSweta, and Vripadguru; Usinara, Sata-ratha, Kanka, Duliduha, and Druma;\\nDambhodbhava, Para, Vena, Sagara, Sankriti, and Nimi; Ajeya, Parasu,\\nPundra, Sambhu, and holy Deva-Vridha; Devahuya, Supratika, and\\nVrihad-ratha; Mahatsaha, Vinitatma, Sukratu, and Nala, the king of the\\nNishadas; Satyavrata, Santabhaya, Sumitra, and the chief Subala;\\nJanujangha, Anaranya, Arka, Priyabhritya, Chuchi-vrata, Balabandhu,\\nNirmardda, Ketusringa, and Brhidbala; Dhrishtaketu, Brihatketu,\\nDriptaketu, and Niramaya; Abikshit, Chapala, Dhurta, Kritbandhu, and\\nDridhe-shudhi; Mahapurana-sambhavya, Pratyanga, Paraha and Sruti. These,\\nO chief, and other Rajas, we hear enumerated by hundreds and by\\nthousands, and still others by millions, princes of great power and\\nwisdom, quitting very abundant enjoyments met death as thy sons have\\ndone! Their heavenly deeds, valour, and generosity, their magnanimity,\\nfaith, truth, purity, simplicity and mercy, are published to the world in\\nthe records of former times by sacred bards of great learning. Though\\nendued with every noble virtue, these have yielded up their lives. Thy\\nsons were malevolent, inflamed with passion, avaricious, and of very\\nevil-disposition. Thou art versed in the Sastras, O Bharata, and art\\nintelligent and wise; they never sink under misfortunes whose\\nunderstandings are guided by the Sastras. Thou art acquainted, O prince,\\nwith the lenity and severity of fate; this anxiety therefore for the\\nsafety of thy children is unbecoming. Moreover, it behoveth thee not to\\ngrieve for that which must happen: for who can avert, by his wisdom, the\\ndecrees of fate? No one can leave the way marked out for him by\\nProvidence. Existence and non-existence, pleasure and pain all have Time\\nfor their root. Time createth all things and Time destroyeth all\\ncreatures. It is Time that burneth creatures and it is Time that\\nextinguisheth the fire. All states, the good and the evil, in the three\\nworlds, are caused by Time. Time cutteth short all things and createth\\nthem anew. Time alone is awake when all things are asleep: indeed, Time\\nis incapable of being overcome. Time passeth over all things without\\nbeing retarded. Knowing, as thou dost, that all things past and future\\nand all that exist at the present moment, are the offspring of Time, it\\nbehoveth thee not to throw away thy reason.\\'\\n\\n\"Sauti said, \\'The son of Gavalgana having in this manner administered\\ncomfort to the royal Dhritarashtra overwhelmed with grief for his sons,\\nthen restored his mind to peace. Taking these facts for his subject,\\nDwaipayana composed a holy Upanishad that has been published to the world\\nby learned and sacred bards in the Puranas composed by them.\\n\\n\"The study of the Bharata is an act of piety. He that readeth even one\\nfoot, with belief, hath his sins entirely purged away. Herein Devas,\\nDevarshis, and immaculate Brahmarshis of good deeds, have been spoken of;\\nand likewise Yakshas and great Uragas (Nagas). Herein also hath been\\ndescribed the eternal Vasudeva possessing the six attributes. He is the\\ntrue and just, the pure and holy, the eternal Brahma, the supreme soul,\\nthe true constant light, whose divine deeds wise and learned recount;\\nfrom whom hath proceeded the non-existent and existent-non-existent\\nuniverse with principles of generation and progression, and birth, death\\nand re-birth. That also hath been treated of which is called Adhyatma\\n(the superintending spirit of nature) that partaketh of the attributes of\\nthe five elements. That also hath been described who is purusha being\\nabove such epithets as \\'undisplayed\\' and the like; also that which the\\nforemost yatis exempt from the common destiny and endued with the power\\nof meditation and Tapas behold dwelling in their hearts as a reflected\\nimage in the mirror.\\n\\n\"The man of faith, devoted to piety, and constant in the exercise of\\nvirtue, on reading this section is freed from sin. The believer that\\nconstantly heareth recited this section of the Bharata, called the\\nIntroduction, from the beginning, falleth not into difficulties. The man\\nrepeating any part of the introduction in the two twilights is during\\nsuch act freed from the sins contracted during the day or the night. This\\nsection, the body of the Bharata, is truth and nectar. As butter is in\\ncurd, Brahmana among bipeds, the Aranyaka among the Vedas, and nectar\\namong medicines; as the sea is eminent among receptacles of water, and\\nthe cow among quadrupeds; as are these (among the things mentioned) so is\\nthe Bharata said to be among histories.\\n\\n\"He that causeth it, even a single foot thereof, to be recited to\\nBrahmanas during a Sradha, his offerings of food and drink to the manes\\nof his ancestors become inexhaustible.\\n\\n\"By the aid of history and the Puranas, the Veda may be expounded; but\\nthe Veda is afraid of one of little information lest he should it. The\\nlearned man who recites to other this Veda of Vyasa reapeth advantage. It\\nmay without doubt destroy even the sin of killing the embryo and the\\nlike. He that readeth this holy chapter of the moon, readeth the whole of\\nthe Bharata, I ween. The man who with reverence daily listeneth to this\\nsacred work acquireth long life and renown and ascendeth to heaven.\\n\\n\"In former days, having placed the four Vedas on one side and the Bharata\\non the other, these were weighed in the balance by the celestials\\nassembled for that purpose. And as the latter weighed heavier than the\\nfour Vedas with their mysteries, from that period it hath been called in\\nthe world Mahabharata (the great Bharata). Being esteemed superior both\\nin substance and gravity of import it is denominated Mahabharata on\\naccount of such substance and gravity of import. He that knoweth its\\nmeaning is saved from all his sins.\\n\\n\\'Tapa is innocent, study is harmless, the ordinance of the Vedas\\nprescribed for all the tribes are harmless, the acquisition of wealth by\\nexertion is harmless; but when they are abused in their practices it is\\nthen that they become sources of evil.\\'\"\\n\\n\\n\\n'"

       "' II  \"The Rishis said, \\'O son of Suta, we wish to hear a full and circumstantial account of the place mentioned by you as Samanta-panchaya.\\'  \"Sauti said, \\'Listen, O ye Brahmanas, to the sacred descriptions I utter O ye best of men, ye deserve to hear of the place known as Samanta-panchaka. In the interval between the Treta and Dwapara Yugas, Rama (the son of Jamadagni) great among all who have borne arms, urged by impatience of wrongs, repeatedly smote the noble race of Kshatriyas. And when that fiery meteor, by his own valour, annihilated the entire tribe of the Kshatriyas, he formed at Samanta-panchaka five lakes of blood. We are told that his reason being overpowered by anger he offered oblations of blood to the manes of his ancestors, standing in the midst of the sanguine waters of those lakes. It was then that his forefathers of whom Richika was the first having arrived there addressed him thus, \\'O Rama, O blessed Rama, O offspring of Bhrigu, we have been gratified with the reverence thou hast shown for thy ancestors and with thy valour, O mighty one! Blessings be upon thee. O thou illustrious one, ask the boon that thou mayst desire.\\'  \"Rama said, \\'If, O fathers, ye are favourably disposed towards me, the boon I ask is that I may be absolved from the sins born of my having annihilated the Kshatriyas in anger, and that the lakes I have formed may become famous in the world as holy shrines.\\' The Pitris then said, \\'So shall it be. But be thou pacified.\\' And Rama was pacified accordingly. The region that lieth near unto those lakes of gory water, from that time hath been celebrated as Samanta-panchaka the holy. The wise have declared that every country should be distinguished by a name significant of some circumstance which may have rendered it famous. In the interval between the Dwapara and the Kali Yugas there happened at Samanta-panchaka the encounter between the armies of the Kauravas and the Pandavas. In that holy region, without ruggedness of any kind, were assembled eighteen Akshauhinis of soldiers eager for battle. And, O Brahmanas, having come thereto, they were all slain on the spot. Thus the name of that region, O Brahmanas, hath been explained, and the country described to you as a sacred and delightful one. I have mentioned the whole of what relateth to it as the region is celebrated throughout the three worlds.\\'  \"The Rishis said, \\'We have a desire to know, O son of Suta, what is implied by the term Akshauhini that hath been used by thee. Tell us in full what is the number of horse and foot, chariots and elephants, which compose an Akshauhini for thou art fully informed.\\'  \"Sauti said, \\'One chariot, one elephant, five foot-soldiers, and three horses form one Patti; three pattis make one Sena-mukha; three sena-mukhas are called a Gulma; three gulmas, a Gana; three ganas, a Vahini; three vahinis together are called a Pritana; three pritanas form a Chamu; three chamus, one Anikini; and an anikini taken ten times forms, as it is styled by those who know, an Akshauhini. O ye best of Brahmanas, arithmeticians have calculated that the number of chariots in an Akshauhini is twenty-one thousand eight hundred and seventy. The measure of elephants must be fixed at the same number. O ye pure, you must know that the number of foot-soldiers is one hundred and nine thousand, three hundred and fifty, the number of horse is sixty-five thousand, six hundred and ten. These, O Brahmanas, as fully explained by me, are the numbers of an Akshauhini as said by those acquainted with the principles of numbers. O best of Brahmanas, according to this calculation were composed the eighteen Akshauhinis of the Kaurava and the Pandava army. Time, whose acts are wonderful assembled them on that spot and having made the Kauravas the cause, destroyed them all. Bhishma acquainted with choice of weapons, fought for ten days. Drona protected the Kaurava Vahinis for five days. Kama the desolator of hostile armies fought for two days; and Salya for half a day. After that lasted for half a day the encounter with clubs between Duryodhana and Bhima. At the close of that day, Aswatthaman and Kripa destroyed the army of Yudishthira in the night while sleeping without suspicion of danger.  \\'O Saunaka, this best of narrations called Bharata which has begun to be repeated at thy sacrifice, was formerly repeated at the sacrifice of Janamejaya by an intelligent disciple of Vyasa. It is divided into several sections; in the beginning are Paushya, Pauloma, and Astika parvas, describing in full the valour and renown of kings. It is a work whose description, diction, and sense are varied and wonderful. It contains an account of various manners and rites. It is accepted by the wise, as the state called Vairagya is by men desirous of final release. As Self among things to be known, as life among things that are dear, so is this history that furnisheth the means of arriving at the knowledge of Brahma the first among all the sastras. There is not a story current in this world but doth depend upon this history even as the body upon the foot that it taketh. As masters of good lineage are ever attended upon by servants desirous of preferment so is the Bharata cherished by all poets. As the words constituting the several branches of knowledge appertaining to the world and the Veda display only vowels and consonants, so this excellent history displayeth only the highest wisdom.  \\'Listen, O ye ascetics, to the outlines of the several divisions (parvas) of this history called Bharata, endued with great wisdom, of sections and feet that are wonderful and various, of subtile meanings and logical connections, and embellished with the substance of the Vedas.  \\'The first parva is called Anukramanika; the second, Sangraha; then Paushya; then Pauloma; the Astika; then Adivansavatarana. Then comes the Sambhava of wonderful and thrilling incidents. Then comes Jatugrihadaha (setting fire to the house of lac) and then Hidimbabadha (the killing of Hidimba) parvas; then comes Baka-badha (slaughter of Baka) and then Chitraratha. The next is called Swayamvara (selection of husband by Panchali), in which Arjuna by the exercise of Kshatriya virtues, won Draupadi for wife. Then comes Vaivahika (marriage). Then comes Viduragamana (advent of Vidura), Rajyalabha (acquirement of kingdom), Arjuna-banavasa (exile of Arjuna) and Subhadra-harana (the carrying away of Subhadra). After these come Harana-harika, Khandava-daha (the burning of the Khandava forest) and Maya-darsana (meeting with Maya the Asura architect). Then come Sabha, Mantra, Jarasandha, Digvijaya (general campaign). After Digvijaya come Raja-suyaka, Arghyaviharana (the robbing of the Arghya) and Sisupala-badha (the killing of Sisupala). After these, Dyuta (gambling), Anudyuta (subsequent to gambling), Aranyaka, and Krimira-badha (destruction of Krimira). The Arjuna-vigamana (the travels of Arjuna), Kairati. In the last hath been described the battle between Arjuna and Mahadeva in the guise of a hunter. After this Indra-lokavigamana (the journey to the regions of Indra); then that mine of religion and virtue, the highly pathetic Nalopakhyana (the story of Nala). After this last, Tirtha-yatra or the pilgrimage of the wise prince of the Kurus, the death of Jatasura, and the battle of the Yakshas. Then the battle with the Nivata-kavachas, Ajagara, and Markandeya-Samasya (meeting with Markandeya). Then the meeting of Draupadi and Satyabhama, Ghoshayatra, Mirga-Swapna (dream of the deer). Then the story of Brihadaranyaka and then Aindradrumna. Then Draupadi-harana (the abduction of Draupadi), Jayadratha-bimoksana (the release of Jayadratha). Then the story of \\'Savitri\\' illustrating the great merit of connubial chastity. After this last, the story of \\'Rama\\'. The parva that comes next is called \\'Kundala-harana\\' (the theft of the ear-rings). That which comes next is \\'Aranya\\' and then \\'Vairata\\'. Then the entry of the Pandavas and the fulfilment of their promise (of living unknown for one year). Then the destruction of the \\'Kichakas\\', then the attempt to take the kine (of Virata by the Kauravas). The next is called the marriage of Abhimanyu with the daughter of Virata. The next you must know is the most wonderful parva called Udyoga. The next must be known by the name of \\'Sanjaya-yana\\' (the arrival of Sanjaya). Then comes \\'Prajagara\\' (the sleeplessness of Dhritarashtra owing to his anxiety). Then Sanatsujata, in which are the mysteries of spiritual philosophy. Then \\'Yanasaddhi\\', and then the arrival of Krishna. Then the story of \\'Matali\\' and then of \\'Galava\\'. Then the stories of \\'Savitri\\', \\'Vamadeva\\', and \\'Vainya\\'.

The number of slokas is eleven thousand, six hundred and sixty-four.  \"The extensive Parva that comes next is called Virata. The Pandavas arriving at the dominions of Virata saw in a cemetery on the outskirts of the city a large shami tree whereon they kept their weapons. Here hath been recited their entry into the city and their stay there in disguise.

The number of slokas is two thousand and fifty.  \"Listen then to (the contents of) the fifth Parva which must be known as Udyoga. While the Pandavas, desirous of victory, were residing in the place called Upaplavya, Duryodhana and Arjuna both went at the same time to Vasudeva, and said, \"You should render us assistance in this war.\" The high-souled Krishna, upon these words being uttered, replied, \"O ye first of men, a counsellor in myself who will not fight and one Akshauhini of troops, which of these shall I give to which of you?\" Blind to his own interests, the foolish Duryodhana asked for the troops; while Arjuna solicited Krishna as an unfighting counsellor. Then is described how, when the king of Madra was coming for the assistance of the Pandavas, Duryodhana, having deceived him on the way by presents and hospitality, induced him to grant a boon and then solicited his assistance in battle; how Salya, having passed his word to Duryodhana, went to the Pandavas and consoled them by reciting the history of Indra\\'s victory (over Vritra). Then comes the despatch by the Pandavas of their Purohita (priest) to the Kauravas. Then is described how king Dhritarashtra of great prowess, having heard the word of the purohita of the Pandavas and the story of Indra\\'s victory decided upon sending his purohita and ultimately despatched Sanjaya as envoy to the Pandavas from desire for peace. Here hath been described the sleeplessness of Dhritarashtra from anxiety upon hearing all about the Pandavas and their friends, Vasudeva and others. It was on this occasion that Vidura addressed to the wise king Dhritarashtra various counsels that were full of wisdom. It was here also that Sanat-sujata recited to the anxious and sorrowing monarch the excellent truths of spiritual philosophy. On the next morning Sanjaya spoke, in the court of the King, of the identity of Vasudeva and Arjuna. It was then that the illustrious Krishna, moved by kindness and a desire for peace, went himself to the Kaurava capital, Hastinapura, for bringing about peace. Then comes the rejection by prince Duryodhana of the embassy of Krishna who had come to solicit peace for the benefit of both parties. Here hath been recited the story of Damvodvava; then the story of the high-souled Matuli\\'s search for a husband for his daughter: then the history of the great sage Galava; then the story of the training and discipline of the son of Bidula. Then the exhibition by Krishna, before the assembled Rajas, of his Yoga powers upon learning the evil counsels of Duryodhana and Karna; then Krishna\\'s taking Karna in his chariot and his tendering to him of advice, and Karna\\'s rejection of the same from pride. Then the return of Krishna, the chastiser of enemies from Hastinapura to Upaplavya, and his narration to the Pandavas of all that had happened. It was then that those oppressors of foes, the Pandavas, having heard all and consulted properly with each other, made every preparation for war. Then comes the march from Hastinapura, for battle, of foot-soldiers, horses, charioteers and elephants. Then the tale of the troops by both parties. Then the despatch by prince Duryodhana of Uluka as envoy to the Pandavas on the day previous to the battle. Then the tale of charioteers of different classes. Then the story of Amba. These all have been described in the fifth Parva called Udyoga of the Bharata, abounding with incidents appertaining to war and peace. O ye ascetics, the great Vyasa hath composed one hundred and eighty-six sections in this Parva. The number of slokas also composed in this by the great Rishi is six thousand, six hundred and ninety-eight.  \"Then is recited the Bhishma Parva replete with wonderful incidents. In this hath been narrated by Sanjaya the formation of the region known as Jambu. Here hath been described the great depression of Yudhishthira\\'s army, and also a fierce fight for ten successive days. In this the high-souled Vasudeva by reasons based on the philosophy of final release drove away Arjuna\\'s compunction springing from the latter\\'s regard for his kindred (whom he was on the eve of slaying). In this the magnanimous Krishna, attentive to the welfare of Yudhishthira, seeing the loss inflicted (on the Pandava army), descended swiftly from his chariot himself and ran, with dauntless breast, his driving whip in hand, to effect the death of Bhishma. In this, Krishna also smote with piercing words Arjuna, the bearer of the Gandiva and the foremost in battle among all wielders of weapons. In this, the foremost of bowmen, Arjuna, placing Shikandin before him and piercing Bhishma with his sharpest arrows felled him from his chariot. In this, Bhishma lay stretched on his bed of arrows. This extensive Parva is known as the sixth in the Bharata. In this have been composed one hundred and seventeen sections. The number of slokas is five thousand, eight hundred and eighty-four as told by Vyasa conversant with the Vedas.  \"Then is recited the wonderful Parva called Drona full of incidents. First comes the installation in the command of the army of the great instructor in arms, Drona: then the vow made by that great master of weapons of seizing the wise Yudhishthira in battle to please Duryodhana; then the retreat of Arjuna from the field before the Sansaptakas, then the overthrow of Bhagadatta like to a second Indra in the field, with the elephant Supritika, by Arjuna; then the death of the hero Abhimanyu in his teens, alone and unsupported, at the hands of many Maharathas including Jayadratha; then after the death of Abhimanyu, the destruction by Arjuna, in battle of seven Akshauhinis of troops and then of Jayadratha; then the entry, by Bhima of mighty arms and by that foremost of warriors-in-chariot, Satyaki, into the Kaurava ranks impenetrable even to the gods, in search of Arjuna in obedience to the orders of Yudhishthira, and the destruction of the remnant of the Sansaptakas. In the Drona Parva, is the death of Alambusha, of Srutayus, of Jalasandha, of Shomadatta, of Virata, of the great warrior-in-chariot Drupada, of Ghatotkacha and others; in this Parva, Aswatthaman, excited beyond measure at the fall of his father in battle, discharged the terrible weapon Narayana. Then the glory of Rudra in connection with the burning (of the three cities). Then the arrival of Vyasa and recital by him of the glory of Krishna and Arjuna. This is the great seventh Parva of the Bharata in which all the heroic chiefs and princes mentioned were sent to their account. The number of sections in this is one hundred and seventy. The number of slokas as composed in the Drona Parva by Rishi Vyasa, the son of Parasara and the possessor of true knowledge after much meditation, is eight thousand, nine hundred and nine.  \"Then comes the most wonderful Parva called Karna. In this is narrated the appointment of the wise king of Madra as (Karna\\'s) charioteer. Then the history of the fall of the Asura Tripura. Then the application to each other by Karna and Salya of harsh words on their setting out for the field, then the story of the swan and the crow recited in insulting allusion: then the death of Pandya at the hands of the high-souled Aswatthaman; then the death of Dandasena; then that of Darda; then Yudhishthira\\'s imminent risk in single combat with Karna in the presence of all the warriors; then the mutual wrath of Yudhishthira and Arjuna; then Krishna\\'s pacification of Arjuna. In this Parva, Bhima, in fulfilment of his vow, having ripped open Dussasana\\'s breast in battle drank the blood of his heart. Then Arjuna slew the great Karna in single combat. Readers of the Bharata call this the eighth Parva. The number of sections in this is sixty-nine and the number of slokas is four thousand, nine hundred and sixty-tour.  \"Then hath been recited the wonderful Parva called Salya. After all the great warriors had been slain, the king of Madra became the leader of the (Kaurava) army. The encounters one after another, of charioteers, have been here described. Then comes the fall of the great Salya at the hands of Yudhishthira, the Just. Here also is the death of Sakuni in battle at the hands of Sahadeva. Upon only a small remnant of the troops remaining alive after the immense slaughter, Duryodhana went to the lake and creating for himself room within its waters lay stretched there for some time. Then is narrated the receipt of this intelligence by Bhima from the fowlers: then is narrated how, moved by the insulting speeches of the intelligent Yudhishthira, Duryodhana ever unable to bear affronts, came out of the waters. Then comes the encounter with clubs, between Duryodhana and Bhima; then the arrival, at the time of such encounter, of Balarama: then is described the sacredness of the Saraswati; then the progress of the encounter with clubs; then the fracture of Duryodhana\\'s thighs in battle by Bhima with (a terrific hurl of) his mace. These all have been described in the wonderful ninth Parva. In this the number of sections is fifty-nine and the number of slokas composed by the great Vyasa--the spreader of the fame of the Kauravas--is three thousand, two hundred and twenty.  \"Then shall I describe the Parva called Sauptika of frightful incidents. On the Pandavas having gone away, the mighty charioteers, Kritavarman, Kripa, and the son of Drona, came to the field of battle in the evening and there saw king Duryodhana lying on the ground, his thighs broken, and himself covered with blood. Then the great charioteer, the son of Drona, of terrible wrath, vowed, \\'without killing all the Panchalas including Drishtadyumna, and the Pandavas also with all their allies, I will not take off armour.\\' Having spoken those words, the three warriors leaving Duryodhana\\'s side entered the great forest just as the sun was setting. While sitting under a large banian tree in the night, they saw an owl killing numerous crows one after another. At the sight of this, Aswatthaman, his heart full of rage at the thought of his father\\'s fate, resolved to slay the slumbering Panchalas. And wending to the gate of the camp, he saw there a Rakshasa of frightful visage, his head reaching to the very heavens, guarding the entrance. And seeing that Rakshasa obstructing all his weapons, the son of Drona speedily pacified by worship the three-eyed Rudra. And then accompanied by Kritavarman and Kripa he slew all the sons of Draupadi, all the Panchalas with Dhrishtadyumna and others, together with their relatives, slumbering unsuspectingly in the night. All perished on that fatal night except the five Pandavas and the great warrior Satyaki. Those escaped owing to Krishna\\'s counsels, then the charioteer of Dhrishtadyumna brought to the Pandavas intelligence of the slaughter of the slumbering Panchalas by the son of Drona. Then Draupadi distressed at the death of her sons and brothers and father sat before her lords resolved to kill herself by fasting. Then Bhima of terrible prowess, moved by the words of Draupadi, resolved, to please her; and speedily taking up his mace followed in wrath the son of his preceptor in arms. The son of Drona from fear of Bhimasena and impelled by the fates and moved also by anger discharged a celestial weapon saying, \\'This is for the destruction of all the Pandavas\\'; then Krishna saying. \\'This shall not be\\', neutralised Aswatthaman\\'s speech. Then Arjuna neutralised that weapon by one of his own. Seeing the wicked Aswatthaman\\'s destructive intentions, Dwaipayana and Krishna pronounced curses on him which the latter returned. Pandava then deprived the mighty warrior-in-chariot Aswatthaman, of the jewel on his head, and became exceedingly glad, and, boastful of their success, made a present of it to the sorrowing Draupadi. Thus the tenth Parva, called Sauptika, is recited. The great Vyasa hath composed this in eighteen sections. The number of slokas also composed (in this) by the great reciter of sacred truths is eight hundred and seventy. In this Parva has been put together by the great Rishi the two Parvas called Sauptika and Aishika.  \"After this hath been recited the highly pathetic Parva called Stri, Dhritarashtra of prophetic eye, afflicted at the death of his children, and moved by enmity towards Bhima, broke into pieces a statue of hard iron deftly placed before him by Krishna (as substitute of Bhima). Then Vidura, removing the distressed Dhritarashtra\\'s affection for worldly things by reasons pointing to final release, consoled that wise monarch. Then hath been described the wending of the distressed Dhritarashtra accompanied by the ladies of his house to the field of battle of the Kauravas. Here follow the pathetic wailings of the wives of the slain heroes. Then the wrath of Gandhari and Dhritarashtra and their loss of consciousness. Then the Kshatriya ladies saw those heroes,--their unreturning sons, brothers, and fathers,--lying dead on the field. Then the pacification by Krishna of the wrath of Gandhari distressed at the death of her sons and grandsons. Then the cremation of the bodies of the deceased Rajas with due rites by that monarch (Yudhishthira) of great wisdom and the foremost also of all virtuous men. Then upon the presentation of water of the manes of the deceased princes having commenced, the story of Kunti\\'s acknowledgment of Karna as her son born in secret. Those have all been described by the great Rishi Vyasa in the highly pathetic eleventh Parva. Its perusal moveth every feeling heart with sorrow and even draweth tears from the eyes. The number of sections composed is twenty-seven. The number of slokas is seven hundred and seventy-five.  \"Twelfth in number cometh the Santi Parva, which increaseth the understanding and in which is related the despondency of Yudhishthira on his having slain his fathers, brothers, sons, maternal uncles and matrimonial relations. In this Parva is described how from his bed of arrows Bhishma expounded various systems of duties worth the study of kings desirous of knowledge; this Parva expounded the duties relative to emergencies, with full indications of time and reasons. By understanding these, a person attaineth to consummate knowledge. The mysteries also of final emancipation have been expatiated upon. This is the twelfth Parva the favourite of the wise. It consists of three hundred and thirty-nine sections, and contains fourteen thousand, seven hundred and thirty-two slokas.  \"Next in order is the excellent Anusasana Parva. In it is described how Yudhishthira, the king of the Kurus, was reconciled to himself on hearing the exposition of duties by Bhishma, the son of Bhagirathi. This Parva treats of rules in detail and of Dharma and Artha; then the rules of charity and its merits; then the qualifications of donees, and the supreme ride-regarding gifts. This Parva also describes the ceremonials of individual duty, the rules of conduct and the matchless merit of truth. This Parva showeth the great merit of Brahmanas and kine, and unraveleth the mysteries of duties in relation to time and place. These are embodied in the excellent Parva called Anusasana of varied incidents. In this hath been described the ascension of Bhishma to Heaven. This is the thirteenth Parva which hath laid down accurately the various duties of men. The number of sections, in this is one hundred and forty-six. The number of slokas is eight thousand.  \"Then comes the fourteenth Parva Aswamedhika. In this is the excellent story of Samvarta and Marutta. Then is described the discovery (by the Pandavas) of golden treasuries; and then the birth of Parikshit who was revived by Krishna after having been burnt by the (celestial) weapon of Aswatthaman. The battles of Arjuna the son of Pandu, while following the sacrificial horse let loose, with various princes who in wrath seized it. Then is shown the great risk of Arjuna in his encounter with Vabhruvahana the son of Chitrangada (by Arjuna) the appointed daughter of the chief of Manipura. Then the story of the mongoose during the performance of the horse-sacrifice. This is the most wonderful Parva called Aswamedhika. The number of sections is one hundred and three. The number of slokas composed (in this) by Vyasa of true knowledge is three thousand, three hundred and twenty.  \"Then comes the fifteenth Parva called Asramvasika. In this, Dhritarashtra, abdicating the kingdom, and accompanied by Gandhari and Vidura went to the woods. Seeing this, the virtuous Pritha also, ever engaged in cherishing her superiors, leaving the court of her sons, followed the old couple. In this is described the wonderful meeting through the kindness of Vyasa of the king (Dhritarashtra) with the spirits of his slain children, grand-children, and other princes, returned from the other world. Then the monarch abandoning his sorrows acquired with his wife the highest fruit of his meritorious actions. In this Parva, Vidura after having leaned on virtue all his life attaineth to the most meritorious state.  \"The learned son of Gavalgana, Sanjaya, also of passions under full control, and the foremost of ministers, attained, in the Parva, to the blessed state. In this, Yudhishthira the just met Narada and heard from him about the extinction of the race of Vrishnis. This is the very wonderful Parva called Asramvasika. The number of sections in this is forty-two, and the number of slokas composed by Vyasa cognisant of truth is one thousand five hundred and six.  \"After this, you know, comes the Maushala of painful incidents. In this, those lion-hearted heroes (of the race of Vrishni) with the scars of many a field on their bodies, oppressed with the curse of a Brahmana, while deprived of reason from drink, impelled by the fates, slew each other on the shores of the Salt Sea with the Eraka grass which (in their hands) became (invested with the fatal attributes of the) thunder. In this, both Balarama and Kesava (Krishna) after causing the extermination of their race, their hour having come, themselves did not rise superior to the sway of all-destroying Time. In this, Arjuna the foremost among men, going to Dwaravati (Dwaraka) and seeing the city destitute of the Vrishnis was much affected and became exceedingly sorry. Then after the funeral of his maternal uncle Vasudeva the foremost among the Yadus (Vrishnis), he saw the heroes of the Yadu race lying stretched in death on the spot where they had been drinking. He then caused the cremation of the bodies of the illustrious Krishna and Balarama and of the principal members of the Vrishni race. Then as he was journeying from Dwaraka with the women and children, the old and the decrepit--the remnants of the Yadu race--he was met on the way by a heavy calamity. He witnessed also the disgrace of his bow Gandiva and the unpropitiousness of his celestial weapons. Seeing all this, Arjuna became despondent and, pursuant to Vyasa\\'s advice, went to Yudhishthira and solicited permission to adopt the Sannyasa mode of life. This is the sixteenth Parva called Maushala The number of sections is eight and the number of slokas composed by Vyasa cognisant of truth is three hundred and twenty.  \"The next is Mahaprasthanika, the seventeenth Parva.  \"In this, those foremost among men the Pandavas abdicating their kingdom went with Draupadi on their great journey called Mahaprasthana. In this, they came across Agni, having arrived on the shore of the sea of red waters. In this, asked by Agni himself, Arjuna worshipped him duly, returned to him the excellent celestial bow called Gandiva. In this, leaving his brothers who dropped one after another and Draupadi also, Yudhishthira went on his journey without once looking back on them. This the seventeenth Parva is called Mahaprasthanika. The number of sections in this is three. The number of slokas also composed by Vyasa cognisant of truth is three hundred and twenty.  \"The Parva that comes after this, you must know, is the extraordinary one called Svarga of celestial incidents. Then seeing the celestial car come to take him, Yudhishthira moved by kindness towards the dog that accompanied him, refused to ascend it without his companion. Observing the illustrious Yudhishthira\\'s steady adherence to virtue, Dharma (the god of justice) abandoning his canine form showed himself to the king. Then Yudhishthira ascending to heaven felt much pain. The celestial messenger showed him hell by an act of deception. Then Yudhishthira, the soul of justice, heard the heart-rending lamentations of his brothers abiding in that region under the discipline of Yama. Then Dharma and Indra showed Yudhishthira the region appointed for sinners. Then Yudhishthira, after leaving the human body by a plunge in the celestial Ganges, attained to that region which his acts merited, and began to live in joy respected by Indra and all other gods. This is the eighteenth Parva as narrated by the illustrious Vyasa. The number of slokas composed, O ascetics, by the great Rishi in this is two hundred and nine.  \"The above are the contents of the Eighteen Parvas. In the appendix (Khita) are the Harivansa and the Vavishya. The number of slokas contained in the Harivansa is twelve thousand.\"  These are the contents of the section called Parva-sangraha. Sauti continued, \"Eighteen Akshauhinis of troops came together for battle. The encounter that ensued was terrible and lasted for eighteen days. He who knows the four Vedas with all the Angas and Upanishads, but does not know this history (Bharata), cannot be regarded as wise. Vyasa of immeasurable intelligence, has spoken of the Mahabharata as a treatise on Artha, on Dharma, and on Kama. Those who have listened to his history can never bear to listen to others, as, indeed, they who have listened to the sweet voice of the male Kokila can never hear the dissonance of the crow\\'s cawing. As the formation of the three worlds proceedeth from the five elements, so do the inspirations of all poets proceed from this excellent composition. O ye Brahman, as the four kinds of creatures (viviparous, oviparous, born of hot moisture and vegetables) are dependent on space for their existence, so the Puranas depend upon this history. As all the senses depend for their exercise upon the various modifications of the mind, so do all acts (ceremonials) and moral qualities depend upon this treatise. There is not a story current in the world but doth depend on this history, even as body upon the food it taketh. All poets cherish the Bharata even as servants desirous of preferment always attend upon masters of good lineage. Even as the blessed domestic Asrama can never be surpassed by the three other Asramas (modes of life) so no poets can surpass this poem.  \"Ye ascetics, shake off all inaction. Let your hearts be fixed on virtue, for virtue is the one only friend of him that has gone to the other world. Even the most intelligent by cherishing wealth and wives can never make these their own, nor are these possessions lasting. The Bharata uttered by the lips of Dwaipayana is without a parallel; it is virtue itself and sacred. It destroyeth sin and produceth good. He that listeneth to it while it is being recited hath no need of a bath in the sacred waters of Pushkara. A Brahmana, whatever sins he may commit during the day through his senses, is freed from them all by reading the Bharata in the evening. Whatever sins he may commit also in the night by deeds, words, or mind, he is freed from them all by reading Bharata in the first twilight (morning). He that giveth a hundred kine with horns mounted with gold to a Brahmana well-posted up in the Vedas and all branches of learning, and he that daily listeneth to the sacred narrations of the Bharata, acquireth equal merit. As the wide ocean is easily passable by men having ships, so is this extensive history of great excellence and deep import with the help of this chapter called Parva sangraha.\"  Thus endeth the section called Parva-sangraha of the Adi Parva of the blessed Mahabharata.
