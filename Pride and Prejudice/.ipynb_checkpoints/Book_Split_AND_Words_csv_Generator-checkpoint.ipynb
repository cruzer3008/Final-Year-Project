Single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune;\\n      four or five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!”\\n\\n      “How so? How can it affect them?”\\n\\n      “My dear Mr. Bennet,” replied his wife, “how can you be so\\n      tiresome! You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of\\n      them.”\\n\\n      “Is that his design in settling here?”\\n\\n      “Design! Nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely\\n      that he _may_ fall in love with one of them, and therefore you\\n      must visit him as soon as he comes.”\\n\\n      “I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may\\n      send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better, for\\n      as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley may like you\\n      the best of the party.”\\n\\n      “My dear, you flatter me. I certainly _have_ had my share of\\n      beauty, but I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now.\\n      When a woman has five grown-up daughters, she ought to give over\\n      thinking of her own beauty.”\\n\\n      “In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of.”\\n\\n      “But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he\\n      comes into the neighbourhood.”\\n\\n      “It is more than I engage for, I assure you.”\\n\\n      “But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it\\n      would be for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are\\n      determined to go, merely on that account, for in general, you\\n      know, they visit no newcomers. Indeed you must go, for it will be\\n      impossible for _us_ to visit him if you do not.”\\n\\n      “You are over-scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be\\n      very glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to\\n      assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he\\n      chooses of the girls; though I must throw in a good word for my\\n      little Lizzy.”\\n\\n      “I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better\\n      than the others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as\\n      Jane, nor half so good-humoured as Lydia. But you are always\\n      giving _her_ the preference.”\\n\\n      “They have none of them much to recommend them,” replied he;\\n      “they are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has\\n      something more of quickness than her sisters.”\\n\\n      “Mr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way?\\n      You take delight in vexing me. You have no compassion for my poor\\n      nerves.”\\n\\n      “You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves.\\n      They are my old friends.
