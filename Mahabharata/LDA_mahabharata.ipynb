      " 2Vaishampayana said, \"After the ladies had been dismissed, Dhritarashtra,the son of Ambika, plunged into grief greater than that which hadafflicted him before, began, O monarch, to indulge in lamentations,exhaling breaths that resembled smoke, and repeatedly waving his arms,and reflecting a little, O monarch, he said these words.\"Dhritarashtra said, 'Alas, O Suta, the intelligence is fraught withgreat grief that I hear from thee, that the Pandavas are all safe andhave suffered no loss in battle. Without doubt, my hard heart is made ofthe essence of thunder, since it breaketh not upon hearing of the fall ofmy sons. Thinking of their ages, O Sanjaya, and of their sports inchildhood, and learning today that all of them have perished, my heartseems to break into pieces. Although in consequence of my blindness Inever saw their forms, still I cherished a great love for them inconsequence of the affection one feels for his children. Hearing thatthey had passed out of childhood and entered the period of youth and thenof early manhood, I became exceedingly glad, O sinless one. Hearing todaythat have been slain and divested of prosperity and energy, I fail toobtain peace of mind, being overwhelmed with grief on account of thedistress that has overtaken them. Come, come, O king of kings(Duryodhana) to me that am without a protector now! Deprived of thee, Omighty-armed one, what will be my plight? Why, O sire, abandoning all theassembled kings dost thou lie on the bare ground, deprived of life, likean ordinary and wretched king? Having been, O monarch, the refuge ofkinsmen and friends, where dost thou go now, O hero, abandoning me thatam blind and old? Where now, O king, is that compassion of thine, thatlove, and that respectfulness? Invincible as thou wert in battle, how,alas, hast thou been slain by the Parthas? Who will now, after I willhave waked from sleep at the proper hour, repeatedly address me in suchendearing and respectful words as, \"O father, O father,\" \"O great king,\"\"O Lord of the world\" and affectionately clasping my neck with moistenedeyes, will seek my orders, saying, \"Command me, O thou of Kuru's race.\"Address me, O son, in that sweet language once more. O dear child, Iheard even these words from thy lips, \"This wide earth is as much ours asit is of Pritha's son. Bhagadatta and Kripa and Shalya and the twoprinces of Avanti and Jayadratha and Bhurishrava and Sala and Somadattaand Bahlika and Ashvatthama and the chief of the Bhojas and the mightyprince of Magadha and Vrihadvala and the ruler of the Kasi and Shakunithe son of Subala and many thousands of Mlecchas and Sakas and Yavanas,and Sudakshina the ruler of the Kambojas and the king of the Trigartasand the grandsire Bhishma and Bharadwaja's son and Gotama's son (Kripa)and Srutayush and Ayutayush and Satayush of great energy, and Jalasandhaand Rishyasringa's son and the Rakshasa Alayudha, and the mighty-armedAlambusa and the great car-warrior Subala--these and numerous otherkings, O best of monarchs, have taken up arms for my sake, prepared tocast away their very lives in great battle, stationed on the field amidstthese, and surrounded by my brothers, I will fight against all theParthas and the Pancalas and the Cedis, O tiger among kings, and the sonsof Draupadi and Satyaki and Kunti-Bhoja and the rakshasa Ghatotkaca. Evenone amongst these, O king, excited with rage, is able to resist in battlethe Pandavas rushing towards him. What need I say then of all theseheroes, every one of whom has wrong to avenge on the Pandavas, whenunited together? All these, O monarch, will fight with the followers ofthe Pandavas and will slay them in battle. Karna alone, with myself, willslay the Pandavas. All the heroic kings will then live under my sway. He,who is their leader, the mighty Vasudeva, will not, he has told me, puton mail for them, O king.\" Even in this way, O Suta, did Duryodhana oftenuse to speak to me. Hearing what he said, I believed that the Pandavaswould be slain in battle. When, however, my sons stationed in the midstof those heroes and exerting themselves vigorously in battle have allbeen slain, what can it be but destiny? When that lord of the world, thevaliant Bhishma, having encountered Shikhandi, met with his death like alion meeting with his at the hands of a jackal, what can it be butdestiny? When the Brahmana Drona, that master of all weapons offensiveand defensive, has been slain by the Pandavas in battle, what can it bebut destiny? When Bhurishrava has been slain in battle, as also Somadattaand king Bahlika, what can it be but destiny? When Bhagadatta, skilled infight from the backs of elephants, has been slain, and when Jayadrathahath been slain, what can it be but destiny? When Sudakshina has beenslain, and Jalasandha of Puru's race, as also Srutayush, and Ayutayush,what can it be but destiny? When the mighty Pandya, that foremost of allwielders of weapons, has been slain in battle by the Pandavas, what canit be but destiny? When Vrihadvala has been slain and the mighty king ofthe Magadhas, and the valiant Ugrayudha, that type of all bowmen; whenthe two princes of Avanti (Vinda and Anuvinda) have been slain, and theruler also of the Trigartas, as also numerous Samsaptakas, what can it bebut destiny? When king Alambusa, and the Rakshasas Alayudha, andRishyasringa's son, have been slain, what can it be but destiny? When theNarayanas have been slain, as also the Gopalas, those troops that wereinvincible in battle, and many thousands of Mlecchas, what can it be butdestiny? When Shakuni, the son of Subala, and the mighty Uluka, calledthe gamester's son, that hero at the head of his forces, have been slain,what can it be but destiny? When innumerable high-souled heroes,accomplished in all kinds of weapons offensive and defensive and enduedwith prowess equal to that of Shakra himself, have been slain, O Suta,when Kshatriyas hailing from diverse realms, O Sanjaya, have all beenslain in battle, what can it be but destiny? Endued with great might, mysons and grandsons have been slain, as also my friends and brethren, whatcan it be but destiny? Without doubt, man takes his birth, subject todestiny. That man who is possessed of good fortune meets with good. I ambereft of good fortune, and, therefore, am deprived of my children, OSanjaya. Old as I am, how shall I now submit to the sway of enemies? I donot think anything other than exile into the woods to be good for me, Olord. Deprived of relatives and kinsmen as I am, I will go into thewoods. Nothing other than an exile into the woods can be better for mewho am fallen into this plight and who am shorn of my wings, O Sanjaya.When Duryodhana had been slain, when Shalya has been slain, whenDuhshasana and Vivingsati and the mighty Vikarna have been slain, howshall I be able to bear the roars of that Bhimasena who hath alone slaina hundred sons of mine in battle? He will frequently speak of theslaughter of Duryodhana in my hearing. Burning with grief and sorrow, Ishall not be able to bear his cruel words.'\"Vaishampayana continued, \"Even thus that king, burning with grief anddeprived of relatives and kinsmen, repeatedly swooned, overwhelmed withsorrow on account of the death of his sons. Having wept for a long while,Dhritarashtra, the son of Ambika, breathed heavy and hot sighs at thethought of his defeat. Overwhelmed with sorrow, and burning with grief,that bull of Bharata's race once more enquired of his charioteer Sanjaya,the son of Gavalgana, the details of what had happened.\"Dhritarashtra said, 'After Bhishma and Drona had been slain, and theSuta's son also overthrown, whom did my warriors make theirgeneralissimo? The Pandavas are slaying without any delay everyone whommy warriors are making their generalissimo in battle. Bhishma was slainat the van of battle by the diadem-decked Arjuna in the very sight of allof you. Even thus was Drona slain in the sight of all of you. Even thuswas the Suta's son, that valiant Karna, slain by Arjuna in the sight ofall the kings. Long before, the high-souled Vidura had told me thatthrough the fault of Duryodhana the population of the Earth would beexterminated. There are some fools that do not see things even thoughthey cast their eyes on them. Those words of Vidura have been even sounto my foolish self. What Vidura of righteous soul, conversant withattributes of everything, then said, hath turned out exactly, for thewords he uttered were nothing but the truth. Afflicted by fate, I did notthen act according to those words. The fruits of that evil course havenow manifested themselves. Describe them to me, O son of Gavalgana, oncemore! Who became the head of our army after Karna's fall? Who was thatcar-warrior who proceeded against Arjuna and Vasudeva? Who were they thatprotected the right wheel of the ruler of the Madras in battle? Whoprotected the left wheel of that hero when he went to battle? Who alsoguarded his rear? How, when all of you were together, could the mightyking of the Madras, as also my son, be slain, O Sanjaya, by the Pandavas?Tell me the details of the great destruction of the Bharatas. Tell me howmy son Duryodhana fell in battle. Tell me how all the Pancalas with theirfollowers, and Dhrishtadyumna and Shikhandi and the five sons ofDraupadi, fell. Tell me how the (five) Pandavas and the two Satwatas(Krishna and Satyaki), and Kripa and Kritavarma and Drona's son, haveescaped with life. I desire to hear everything about the manner in whichthe battle occurred and the kind of battle it was. Thou art skilled, OSanjaya, in narration. Tell me everything.'\"\n"

      " LXVI\"Yudhishthira said, 'I desire to hear, O grandsire, what the merits areof that person who makes the gift of a pair of sandals unto a Brahmanawhose feet are burning or being scorched by hot sand, while he iswalking.'\"Bhishma said, 'The man, that gives unto the Brahmanas sandals for theprotection of their feet, succeeds in crushing all thorns and gets overevery kind of difficulty. Such a man, O Yudhishthira, stays over theheads of all his foes. Vehicles of pure splendour, with mules harnessedthereto, and made of gold and silver, O monarch, approach him. He whomakes a gift of sandals is said to earn the merit of making the gift of avehicle with well-broken steeds yoked thereto.'\"Yudhishthira said, 'Do thou tell me in detail once more, O grandsire, ofthe merits that attach to gifts of sesame and land and kine and food.'\"Bhishma said, 'Do thou hear, O son of Kunti, what the merits are thatattach to the gift of sesame. Hearing me, do thou, then, O best of theKurus, make gifts of sesame according to the ordinance. Sesame seeds werecreated by the Self-born Brahman as the best food for the Pitris. Hence,gifts of sesame seeds always gladden the Pitris greatly. The man whomakes gifts of sesame seeds, in the month of Magha, unto the Brahmanas,has never to visit hell which abounds with all frightful creatures. Hewho adores the Pitris with offerings of sesame seeds is regarded asworshipping the deities at all the sacrifices. One should never perform aSraddha with offerings of sesame seeds without cherishing somepurpose.[340] Sesame seeds sprang from the limbs of the great RishiKasyapa. Hence, in the matter of gifts, they have come to be regarded aspossessed of high efficacy. Sesame seeds bestow both prosperity andpersonal beauty and cleans the giver of all his sins It is for thisreason that the gift of sesame seeds is distinguished above the gift ofevery other article. Apastamva of great intelligence, and Kankha andLikhita, and the great Rishi Gautama have all ascended to heaven byhaving made gifts of sesame seeds. Those Brahmanas that make Homa withofferings of sesame, abstain from sexual intercourse, and are observantof the religion of Pravritti or acts, are regarded as equal (in purityand efficacy) to bovine Havi. The gift of sesame seeds is distinguishedabove all gifts. Amongst all gifts, the gifts of sesame is regarded asproductive of inexhaustible merit. In ancient times when Havi (clarifiedbutter) on one occasion had become unobtainable the Rishi Kusika, Oscorcher of foes, made offerings of sesame seeds to his three sacrificialfires and succeeded in attaining to an excellent end. I have thus saidunto thee, O chief of the Kurus, what the regulations are respecting theexcellent gift of sesame seeds. It is in consequence of these regulationsthat the gift of sesame seeds has come to be regarded as endued with verysuperior merit. After this, listen to what I would say. Once on a timethe deities, desirous of making a sacrifice, repaired, O monarch, to thepresence of the Self-born Brahman. Having met Brahman, being desirous ofperforming a sacrifice on earth, they begged him for a piece ofauspicious earth, saying, 'We want it for our sacrifice.''The deities said, 'O illustrious one, thou art the lord of all the earthas also of all the deities. With thy permission, O highly blessed one, wedesire to perform a sacrifice. The person who has not obtained by lawfulmeans the earth whereon to make the sacrificial altar, earns not themerit of the sacrifice he performs. Thou art the Lord of all the universeconsisting of its mobile and immobile objects. Hence, it behoveth thee togrant us a piece of earth for the sacrifice we wish to make.'\"Brahman said, 'Ye foremost of deities, I shall give you a piece of earthwhereon, ye sons of Kasyapa, you shall perform your intended sacrifice.'\"The deities said, 'Our wishes, O holy one, have been crowned withfruition. We shall perform our sacrifice even here with large Dakshina.Let, however, the Munis always adore the piece of earth. Then there cameto that place Agastya and Kanwa and Bhrigu and Atri and Vrishakapi, andAsita and Devala. The high-souled deities then, O thou of unfading glory,performed their sacrifice. Those foremost of gods concluded it in duetime. Having completed that sacrifice of theirs on the breast of thatforemost of mountains. Himavat, the deities attached to the gift of eartha sixth part of the merit arising from their sacrifice. The man who makesa gift of even a span of earth (unto a Brahmana) with reverence andfaith, has never to languish under any difficulty and has never to meetwith any calamity. By making a gift of a house that keeps out cold, wind,and sun, and that stand upon a piece of clean land, the giver attains tothe region of the deities and does not fall down even when his meritbecomes exhausted. By making a gift of a residential house, the giver,possessed of wisdom, lives, O king, in happiness in the company of Sakra.Such a person receives great honours in heaven. That person in whosehouse a Brahmana of restrained sense, well-versed in the Vedas, andbelonging by birth to a family of preceptors, resides in contentment,succeeds in attaining to and enjoying a region of high felicity.[341]After the same manner, O best of the Bharatas, by giving away a shed forthe shelter of kine that can keep out cold and rain and that issubstantial in structure, the giver rescues seven generations of his race(from hell). By giving away a piece of arable earth the giver attains toexcellent prosperity. By giving a piece of earth containing mineralwealth, the giver aggrandises his family and race. One should never giveaway any earth that is barren or that is burnt (arid); nor should onegive away any earth that is in close vicinity to a crematorium, or thathas been owned and enjoyed by a sinful person before such gift. When aman performs a Sraddha in honour of the Pitris on earth belonging toanother person, the Pitris render both the gift of that earth and theSraddha itself futile.[342] Hence, one possessed of wisdom should buyeven a small piece of earth and make a gift of it. The Pinda that isoffered to one's ancestors on earth that has been duly purchased becomesinexhaustible.[343] Forests, and mountains, and rivers, and Tirthas areregarded as having no owners. No earth need be purchased here forperforming Sraddhas. Even this has been said, O king, on the subject ofthe merits of making gifts of earth. After this, O sinless one, I shalldiscourse to thee on the subject of the gift of kine. Kine are regardedas superior to all the ascetics. And since it is so, the divine Mahadevafor that reason performed penance in their company. Kine, O Bharata,dwell in the region of Brahman, in the company of Soma. Constituting asit does the highest end, regenerate Rishis crowned with success strive toattain to that very region. Kine benefit human beings with milk, ghee,curds, dung, skin, bones, horns, and hair, O Bharata. Kine do not feelcold or heat. They always work. The season of rains also cannot afflictthem at all. And since kine attain to the highest end (viz., residence inthe region of Brahman), in the company of Brahmanas, therefore do thewise say that king and Brahmanas are equal. In days of yore, kingRantideva performed a grand sacrifice in which an immense number of kinewere offered up and slaughtered. From the juice that was secreted by theskins of the slaughtered animals, a river was formed that came to becalled by the name of Charmanwati. Kine no longer form animals fit forsacrifice. They now constitute animals that are fit for gift. That kingwho makes gifts of kine unto the foremost of Brahmanas, O monarch, issure to get over every calamity even if he falls into it. The man whomakes a gift of a thousand kine has not to go to hell. Such a person, Oruler of men, obtains victory everywhere. The very chief of the deitieshad said that the milk of kine is nectar. For this reason, one who makesa gift of a cow is regarded as making a gift of nectar. Personsconversant with the Vedas have declared that the Ghee manufactured fromcows' milk is the very best of all libations poured into the sacrificialfire. For this reason, the man who makes a gift of a cow is regarded asmaking a gift of a libation for sacrifice. A bovine bull is theembodiment of heaven. He who makes the gift of a bovine bull unto anaccomplished Brahmana, receives great honours in heaven. Kine, O chief ofBharata's race, are said to be the life-breath of living creatures.Hence, the man who makes the gift of a cow is said to make the gift oflife-breath. Persons conversant with the Vedas have said that kineconstitute the great refuge of living creatures. Hence, the man who makesthe gift of a cow is regarded as making the gift of what is the highrefuge for all creatures. The cow should never be given away forslaughter (i.e., unto one who will kill her); nor should the cow be givenunto a tiller of the soil; nor should the cow be given unto an atheist.The cow should not also, O chief of the Bharatas, be given unto one whoseoccupation is the keeping of kine.[344] The wise have said that a personwho gives away the cow unto any of such sinful persons has to sink intoeverlasting hell. One should never give unto a Brahmana a cow that islean, or that produces calves that do not live, or that is barren, orthat is diseased, or that is defective of limb, or that is worn out withtoil. The man that gives away ten thousand kine attains to heaven andsports in bliss in the companionship of Indra. The man who makes gifts ofkine by hundred thousand acquires many regions of inexhaustible felicity.Thus have I recited to thee the merits attaching to the gift of kine andof sesame, as also to the gift of earth. Listen now to me as I discourseto thee upon the gift of food, O Bharata. The gift of food, O son ofKunti, is regarded as a very superior gift. King Rantideva in days ofyore ascended to heaven by having made gifts of food. That king, who makea gift of food unto one that is toil-worn and hungry, attains to thatregion of supreme felicity which is the Self-born's own. Men fail toattain by gifts of gold and robes and of other thing, to that felicity towhich givers of food succeed in attaining, O thou of great puissance!Food is, indeed, the first article. Food is regarded as the highestprosperity. It is from food that life springs, as also energy and prowessand strength. He who always makes gifts of food, with attention, unto therighteous, never falls into any distress.. Even this has been said byParasara. Having worshipped the deities duly, food should be firstdedicated to them. It has been said, O king, that the kind of food thatis taken by particular men is taken also by the deities those menworship.[345] That man who makes a gift of food in the bright fortnightof the month of Kartika, succeeds in crossing every difficulty here addattains to inexhaustible felicity hereafter. That man who makes a gift offood unto a hungry guest arrived at his abode, attains to all thoseregions, O chief of Bharata's race, that are reserved for personsacquainted with Brahma. The man who makes gifts of food is sure to crossevery difficulty and distress. Such a person comes over every sin andcleanses himself of every evil act. I have thus discoursed to thee uponthe merits of making gifts of food, of sesame, of earth, and of kine.'\"\n",

      " LXII\"Nala said, 'Surely, thy father's kingdom is as my own. But thither Iwill not, by any means, repair in this extremity. Once I appeared therein glory, increasing thy joy. How can I go there now in misery,augmenting thy grief?'\"Vrihadaswa continued, 'Saying this again and again unto Damayanti, kingNala, wrapped in half a garment, comforted his blessed wife. And bothattired in one cloth and wearied with hunger and thirst, in course oftheir wanderings, at last they came to a sheltered shed for travellers.And arrived at this place, the king of the Nishadhas sat down on the bareearth with the princes of Vidarbha. And wearing the same piece of cloth(with Damayanti), and dirty, and haggard, and stained with dust, he fellasleep with Damayanti on the ground in weariness. And suddenly plunged indistress, the innocent and delicate Damayanti with every mark of goodfortune, fell into a profound slumber. And, O monarch, while she slept,Nala, with heart and mind distraught, could not slumber calmly as before.And reflecting on the loss of his kingdom, the desertion of his friends,and his distress in the woods, he thought with himself, 'What availeth myacting thus? And what if I act not thus? Is death the better for me now?Or should I desert my wife? She is truly devoted to me and suffereth thisdistress for my sake. Separated from me, she may perchance wander to herrelatives. Devoted as she is to me, if she stayeth with me, distress willsurely be hers; while it is doubtful, if I desert her. On the other hand,it is not unlikely that she may even have happiness some time.'Reflecting upon this repeatedly, and thinking of it again and again, heconcluded, O monarch, that the desertion of Damayanti was the best coursefor him. And he also thought, 'Of high fame and auspicious fortune, anddevoted to me, her husband, she is incapable of being injured by any oneon the way on account of her energy.' Thus his mind that was influencedby the wicked Kali, dwelling upon Damayanti, was made up for desertingher. And then thinking of his own want of clothing, and of her being cladin a single garment, he intended to cut off for himself one half ofDamayanti's attire. And he thought, 'How shall I divide this garment, sothat my beloved one may not perceive?' And thinking of this, the royalNala began to walk up and down that shed. And, O Bharata, pacing thus toand fro, he found a handsome sword lying near the shed, unsheathed. Andthat repressor of foes, having, with that sword cut off one half of thecloth, and throwing the instrument away, left the daughter of Vidharbhainsensible in her sleep and went away. But his heart failing him, theking of the Nishadhas returned to the shed, and seeing Damayanti (again),burst into tears. And he said, 'Alas! that beloved one of mine whomneither the god of wind nor the sun had seen before, even she sleepethto-day on the bare earth, like one forlorn. Clad in this severed piece ofcloth, and lying like one distracted, how will the beauteous one ofluminous smiles behave when she awaketh? How will the beautiful daughterof Bhima, devoted to her lord, all alone and separated from me, wanderthrough these deep woods inhabited by beasts and serpents? O blessed one,may the Adityas and the Vasus, and the twin Aswins together with theMarutas protect thee, thy virtue being thy best guard.' And addressingthus his dear wife peerless on earth in beauty, Nala strove to go, reftof reason by Kali. Departing and still departing, king Nala returnedagain and again to that shed, dragged away by Kali but drawn back bylove. And it seemed as though the heart of the wretched king was rent intwain, and like a swing, he kept going out from cabin and coming backinto it. At length after lamenting long and piteously, Nala stupefied andbereft of sense by Kali went away, forsaking that sleeping wife of his.Reft of reason through Kali's touch, and thinking of his conduct, theking departed in sorrow, leaving his, wife alone in that solitaryforest.'\"\n",

Let him who entering Rahu's mouthdrinketh Soma in the night and who becoming Swarbhanu devoureth Suryaalso, protect me![1436] The deities, who are mere infants and who haveall sprung from thee after Brahman's creation, enjoy their respectiveshares (in sacrificial offerings). Let them (peacefully) enjoy thoseofferings made with Swaha and Swadha, and let them derive pleasure fromthose presents.

I alwaysbow to those Rudras who dwell in rivers, in oceans, in hills andmountains, in mountain-caves, in the roots of trees, in cow-pens, ininaccessible forests, in the intersections of roads, in roads, in opensquares, in banks (of rivers and lakes and oceans), in elephant-sheds, instables, in car-sheds, in deserted gardens and houses, in the five primalelements, and in the cardinal and subsidiary directions. I bow repeatedlyunto them that dwell in the space amidst the Sun and the Moon, as also inrays of the Sun and the Moon, and them that dwell in the nether regions,and them that have betaken themselves to Renunciation and other superiorpractices for the sake of the Supreme.[1439] I bow always unto them thatare unnumbered, that are unmeasured, and that have no form, unto thoseRudras, that is, that are endued with infinite attributes. Since thou, ORudra, art the Creator of all creatures, since, O Hara, thou art theMaster of all creatures, and since thou art the indwelling Soul of allcreatures, therefore wert thou not invited by me (to my Sacrifices).Since thou art He who is adored in all sacrifices with plentiful gifts,and since it is Thou that art the Creator of all things, therefore I didnot invite thee. Or, perhaps, O god, stupefied by thy subtile illusion Ifailed to invite thee. Be gratified with me, blessed by thyself, O Bhava,with me possessed by the quality of Rajas. My Mind, my Understanding, andmy Chitta all dwell in thee, O god!\"Hearing these adorations, that Lord of all creatures, viz., Mahadeva,ceased (to think of inflicting further injuries on Daksha). Indeed,highly gratified, the illustrious deity addressed Daksha, saying, 'ODaksha of excellent vows, pleased have I been with these adorations ofthine. Thou needst not praise me more. Thou shalt attain to mycompanionship. Through my grace, O progenitor of creatures, thou shaltearn the fruit of a thousand horse-sacrifices, and a hundred Vajapeyas(in consequence of this one incomplete sacrifice of thine).\"Once more, Mahadeva, that thorough master of words, addressed Daksha andsaid unto him these words fraught with high consolation, 'Be thou theforemost of all creatures in the world. Thou shouldst not, O Daksha,entertain any feelings of grief for these injuries inflicted on thySacrifice. It has been seen that in former Kalpas too I had to destroythy Sacrifice.[1440] O thou of excellent vows, I shall grant thee againsome more boons. Take them from me. Dispelling this cheerlessness thatoverspreads thy face, listen to me with undivided attention. With the aidof arguments addressed to reason the deities and the Danavas haveextracted from the Vedas consisting of six branches and from the systemof Sankhya and Yoga a creed in consequence of which they have practisedthe austerest penances for many long years. The religion, however, whichI have extracted, is unparalleled, and productive of benefits on everyside. It is open to men in all modes of life to practise it. It leads toEmancipation. It may be acquired in many years or through merit bypersons who have restrained their senses. It is shrouded in mystery. Theythat are divested of wisdom regard it as censurable. It is opposed to theduties laid down in respect of the four orders of men and the four modesof life, and agrees with those duties in only a few particulars. Theythat are well-skilled in the science of (drawing) conclusions (frompremises) can understand its propriety: and they who have transcended allthe modes of life are worthy of adopting it. In days of yore, O Daksha,this auspicious religion called Pasupata had been extracted by me. Theproper observance of that religion produces immense benefits. Let thosebenefits be thine, O highly blessed one! Cast off this fever of thyheart.' Having said these words, Mahadeva, with his spouse (Uma) and withall his attendants disappeared from the view of Daksha of immeasurableprowess. He who would recite this hymn that was first uttered by Dakshaor who would listen to it when recited by another, would never meet withthe smallest evil and would attain to a long life. Indeed, as Siva is theforemost of all the deities, even so is this hymn, agreeable with theSrutis, is the foremost of all hymns. Persons desirous of fame, kingdom,happiness, pleasure, profit, and wealth, as also those desirous oflearning, should listen with feelings of devotion to the recital of thishymn. One suffering from disease, one distressed by pain, one plungedinto melancholy, one afflicted by thieves or by fear, one under thedispleasure of the king in respect of his charge, becomes freed from fear(by listening or reciting this hymn). By listening to or reciting thishymn, one, in even this earthly body of his, attains to equality with thespirits forming the attendants of Mahadeva. One becomes endued withenergy and fame, and cleansed of all sin (through the virtue of thishymn). Neither Rakshasas, nor Pisachas, nor ghosts, nor Vinayakas, createdisturbances in his house where this hymn is recited. That woman, again,who listens to this hymn with pious faith, observing the while thepractices of Brahmacharya, wins worship as a goddess in the family of hersire and that of her husband.[1441] All the acts of that person becomealways crowned with success who listens or recites with rapt attention tothe whole of this hymn. In consequence of the recitation of this hymn allthe wishes one forms in one's mind and all the wishes one clothes inwords become crowned with fruition. That man obtains all objects ofenjoyment and pleasure and all things that are wished for by him, who,practising self-restraint, makes according to due rites offerings untoMahadeva, Guha, Uma, and Nandi, and after that utters their names withoutdelay, in proper order and with devotion. Such a man, departing from thislife, ascends to heaven, and has never to take birth among theintermediate animals or birds. This was said even by the puissant Vyasa,the son of Parasara.'\"\n",

I had also heard from thee about the greatmonarchs that were born in this line. But I have not been gratified, thischarming account being so short. Therefore, be pleased, O Brahmana, torecite the delightful narrative just in detail commencing from Manu, thelord of creation. Who is there that will not be charmed with such anaccount, as it is sacred? The fame of these monarchs increased by theirwisdom, virtue, accomplishments, and high character, hath so swelled asto cover the three worlds.

On conclusion of the sacrifice, Saraswati appeared inperson before the king and chose him for husband. And he begat upon her ason named Tansu. Here occurs a sloka descriptive of Tansu's descendants.\"Tansu was born of Saraswati by Matinara. And Tansu himself begat a sonnamed Ilina on his wife, the princess Kalingi.\"Ilina begat on his wife Rathantari five sons, of whom Dushmanta was theeldest. And Dushmanta took to wife Sakuntala, the daughter of Viswamitra.And he begat on her a son named Bharata. Here occurs two slokas about(Dushmanta's) descendants.\"The mother is but the sheath of flesh in which the father begets theson. Indeed the father himself is the son. Therefore, O Dushmanta,support thy son and insult not Sakuntala. O god among men, the fatherhimself becoming the son rescueth himself from hell. Sakuntala hath trulysaid that thou art the author of this child's being.\"It is for this (i.e., because the king supported his child after hearingthe above speech of the celestial messenger) that Sakuntala's son came tobe called Bharata (the supported). And Bharata married Sunanda, thedaughter of Sarvasena, the king of Kasi, and begat upon her the son namedBhumanyu. And Bhumanyu married Vijaya, the daughter of Dasarha.

And Bhishma, moved by the desire of doing goodto his father, got him married to Satyavati who was also calledGandhakali. And in her maidenhood she had a son by Parasara, namedDwaipayana. And upon her Santanu begat two other sons named Chitrangadaand Vichitravirya. And before they attained to majority, Chitrangada hadbeen slain by the Gandharvas. But Vichitravirya became king, and marriedthe two daughters of the king of Kasi, named Amvika and Amvalika. ButVichitravirya died childless. Then Satyavati began to think as to how thedynasty of Dushmanta might be perpetuated. Then she recollected the RishiDwaipayana. The latter coming before her, asked, 'What are thy commands?''She said, 'Thy brother Vichitravirya hath gone to heaven childless.Beget virtuous children for him.' Dwaipayana, consenting to this, begatthree children, viz., Dhritarashtra, Pandu, and Vidura. KingDhritarashtra had a hundred sons by his wife, Gandhari in consequence ofthe boon granted by Dwaipayana. And amongst those hundred sons ofDhritarashtra, four became celebrated. They are Duryodhana, Duhsasana,Vikarna, and Chitrasena. And Pandu had two jewels of wives, viz., Kunti,also called Pritha, and Madri. One day Pandu, while out a-hunting, saw adeer covering its mate. That was really a Rishi in the form of a deer.Seeing the deer in that attitude, he killed it with his arrows, beforeits desire was gratified. Pierced with the king's arrow, the deer quicklychanged its form and became a Rishi, and said unto Pandu, 'O Pandu, thouart virtuous and acquainted also with the pleasure derived from thegratification of one's desire. My desire unsatisfied, thou hast slain me!Therefore, thou also, when so engaged and before thou art gratified,shalt die!' Pandu, hearing this curse, became pale, and from that timewould not go in unto his wives. And he told them these words, 'Through myown fault, I have been cursed! But I have heard that for the childlessthere are no regions hereafter.' Therefore, he solicited Kunti to haveoffspring raised for him. And Kunti said, 'Let it be', So she raised upoffspring. By Dharma she had Yudhishthira; by Maruta, Bhima: and bySakra, Arjuna. And Pandu, well-pleased with her, said, 'This thy co-wifeis also childless. Therefore, cause her also to bear children.' Kuntisaying, 'So be it,' imparted unto Madri the mantra of invocation. And onMadri were raised by the twin Aswins, the twins Nakula and Sahadeva. And(one day) Pandu, beholding Madri decked with ornaments, had his desirekindled. And, as soon as he touched her, he died. Madri ascended thefuneral pyre with her lord. And she said unto Kunti, 'Let these twins ofmine be brought up by thee with affection.' After some time those fivePandavas were taken by the ascetics of the woods to Hastinapura and thereintroduced to Bhishma and Vidura. And after introducing them, theascetics disappeared in the very sight of all. And after the conclusionof the speech of those ascetics, flowers were showered down upon thespot, and the celestial drums also were beaten in the skies. The Pandavaswere then taken (by Bhishma). They then represented the death of theirfather and performed his last honours duly. And as they were brought upthere, Duryodhana became exceedingly jealous of them. And the sinfulDuryodhana acting like Rakshasa tried various means to drive them away.But what must be can never be frustrated. So all Duryodhana's effortsproved futile. Then Dhritarashtra sent them, by an act of deception toVaranavata, and they went there willingly. There an endeavour was made toburn them to death; but it proved abortive owing to the warning counselsof Vidura. After that the Pandavas slew Hidimva, and then they went to atown called Ekachakra. There also they slew a Rakshasa of the name ofVaka and then went to Panchala. And there obtaining Draupadi for a wifethey returned to Hastinapura. And there they dwelt for some time in peaceand begat children. And Yudhishthira begat Prativindhya; Bhima, Sutasoma;Arjuna, Srutakriti; Nakula, Satanika; and Sahadeva, Srutakarman. Besidesthese, Yudhishthira, having obtained for his wife Devika, the daughter ofGovasana of the Saivya tribe, in a self-choice ceremony, begat upon her ason named Yaudheya. And Bhima also obtaining for a wife Valandhara, thedaughter of the king of Kasi, offered his own prowess as dower and begatupon her a son named Sarvaga. And Arjuna also, repairing to Dwaravati,brought away by force Subhadra. the sweet-speeched sister of Vasudeva,and returned in happiness to Hastinapura. And he begat upon her a sonnamed Abhimanyu endued with all accomplishments and dear to Vasudevahimself. And Nakula obtaining for his wife Karenumati, the princess ofChedi, begat upon her a son named Niramitra. And Sahadeva also marriedVijaya, the daughter of Dyutimat, the king of Madra, obtaining her in aself-choice ceremony and begat upon her a son named Suhotra. AndBhimasena had some time before begat upon Hidimva a son namedGhatotkacha. These are the eleven sons of the Pandavas. Amongst them all,Abhimanyu was the perpetuator of the family. He married Uttara, thedaughter of Virata, who brought forth a dead child whom Kunti took up onher lap at the command of Vasudeva who said, 'I will revive this child ofsix months.' And though born before time, having been burnt by the fireof (Aswatthaman's weapon) and, therefore, deprived of strength and energyhe was revived by Vasudeva and endued with strength, energy and prowess.And after reviving him, Vasudeva said, 'Because this child hath been bornin an extinct race, therefore, he shall be called Parikshit'. AndParikshit married Madravati, thy mother, O king, and thou art born toher, O Janamejaya! Thou hast also begotten two sons on thy wifeVapushtama, named Satanika and Sankukarna. And Satanika also hathbegotten one son named Aswamedhadatta upon the princess of Videha.\"Thus have I, O king, recited the history of the descendants of Puru andof the Pandavas. This excellent, virtue-increasing, and sacred historyshould ever be listened to by vow-observing Brahmanas, by Kshatriyasdevoted to the practices of their order and ready to protect theirsubjects; by Vaisyas with attention, and by Sudras with reverence, whosechief occupation is to wait upon the three other orders. Brahmanasconversant in the Vedas and other persons, who with attention andreverence recite this sacred history or listen to it when recited,conquer the heavens and attain to the abode of the blessed. They are alsoalways respected and adored by the gods, Brahamanas, and other men. Thisholy history of Bharata hath been composed by the sacred and illustriousVyasa. Veda-knowing Brahmanas and other persons who with reverence andwithout malice hear it recited, earn great religious merits and conquerthe heavens. Though sinning, they are not disregarded by any one. Hereoccurs a sloka, 'This (Bharata) is equal unto the Vedas: it is holy andexcellent. It bestoweth wealth, fame, and life. Therefore, it should belistened to by men with rapt attention.'\"\n",

      " XCIII\"Vamadeva continued, 'When the king, who is powerful, acts unrighteouslytowards the weak, they who take their birth in his race imitate the sameconduct. Others, again, imitate that wretch who sets sin agoing. Suchimitation of the man ungoverned by restraints soon brings destructionupon the kingdom. The conduct of a king who is observant of his properduties, is accepted by men in general as a model for imitation. Theconduct, however, of a king who falls away from his duties, is nottolerated by his very kinsfolk. That rash king who, disregarding theinjunctions laid down in the scriptures, acts with highhandedness in hiskingdom, very soon meets with destruction. That Kshatriya who does notfollow the conduct observed from days of old by other Kshatriyas.conquered or unconquered, is said to fall away from Kshatriya duties.Having seized in battle a royal foe that did some good to the conqueroron a former occasion, that king who does not, actuated by malice, pay himhonours, is said to fall away from Kshatriya duties. The king shoulddisplay his power, live cheerfully, and do what is necessary in seasonsof danger. Such a ruler becomes the beloved of all creatures and neverfalls away from prosperity. If thou doest disservice to any person, thoushouldst, when the turn comes, do him service. One who is not lovedbecomes an object of love, if he does what is agreeable. Untruthfulspeeches should be avoided. Thou shouldst do good to others without beingsolicited. Thou shouldst never abandon righteousness from lust or wrathor malice. Do not give harsh answers when questioned by anybody. Do notutter undignified speeches. Never be in a hurry to do anything. Neverindulge in malice. By such means is a foe won over. Do not give way toexclusive joy when anything agreeable occurs, nor suffer thyself to beoverwhelmed with sorrow when anything disagreeable occurs. Never indulgein grief when thy pecuniary resources are exhausted, and always rememberthe duty of doing good to thy subjects. That king who always does what isagreeable by virtue of his disposition achieves success in all hismeasures and is never shorn of prosperity. The king should always, withheedfulness, cherish that devoted servant who abstains from doing what isinjurious to his master and who always does what is for his good. Heshould appoint in all great affairs persons that have subjugated theirsenses, that are devotedly loyal and of pure behaviour, and that arepossessed of ability. That person, who by the possession of suchqualifications pleases the king and who is never heedless in taking careof the interests of his master should be appointed by the king in theaffairs of his kingdom. On the other hand, the king becomes divested ofprosperity by appointing to important offices men that are fools andslaves of their senses, that are covetous and of disrespectable conduct,that are deceitful and hypocritical, that are malicious, wicked-souled,and ignorant, that are low-minded, and addicted to drink, gambling,women, and hunting. That king, who, first protecting his own self,protects others that deserve protection, feels the satisfaction offinding his subjects growing in prosperity. Such a king succeeds also inobtaining greatness. A king should, by secret agents that are devoted tohim, watch the conduct and acts of other kings. By such means can heobtain superiority. Having injured a powerful king, one should notcomfort himself with the thought that he (the injurer) lives at a greatdistance from the injured. Such a king when injured falls upon theinjurer like the hawk swooping down upon its prey, in moments ofheedlessness. A king whose power has been consolidated and who isconfident of his own strength, should assail a neighbour who is weakerthan himself but never one that is stronger. A king who is devoted tovirtue, having acquired the sovereignty of the earth by prowess, shouldprotect his subjects righteously and slaughter foes in battle. Everythingbelonging to this world is destined to destruction. Nothing here isdurable. For this reason, the king, adhering to righteousness, shouldprotect his subjects righteously. The defence of forts, battle,administration of justice, consultations on questions of policy, andkeeping the subjects in happiness, these five acts contribute to enlargethe dominions of a king. That king who takes proper care of these isregarded to be the best of kings. By always attending to these, a kingsucceeds in protecting his kingdom. It is impossible, however, for oneman to supervise all these matters at all times. Making over suchsupervision to his ministers, a King may govern the earth for ever.[277]The people make such a person their king who is liberal, who shares allobjects of enjoyment with others, who is possessed of a mild disposition,who is of pure behaviour, and who will never abandon his subjects. He isobeyed in the world who, having listened to counsels of wisdom, acceptsthem, abandoning his own opinions. That king who does not tolerate thecounsels of a well-wisher in consequence of their opposition to his ownviews, who listens with inattention to what is said unto him inopposition to his views, and who does not always follow the conduct ofhigh and noble persons conquered or unconquered, is said to fall awayfrom the duties of Kshatriyas. From ministers that have once beenchastised, from women in especial, from mountains and inaccessibleregions, from elephants and horses and reptiles, the king should always,with heedfulness, protect his own self.[278] That king who, abandoninghis chief ministers, makes favourites of low persons, soon falls intodistress, and never succeeds in compassing the (intended) ends of hismeasures. That king of infirm soul, who, yielding to the influence ofwrath and malice, does not love and honour those amongst his kinsmen thatare possessed of good qualities, is said to live on the very verge ofdestruction. That king, who attaches to himself accomplished persons bydoing good to them even though he may not like them at heart, succeeds inenjoying fame for ever. Thou shouldst never impose taxes unseasonably.Thou shouldst not be grieved at the occurrence of anything disagreeable,nor rejoice exceedingly at anything agreeable. Thou shouldst always setthyself to the accomplishment of good acts. Who amongst the dependentkings is truly devoted to thee, and who is loyal to thee from fear, andwho amongst them has faults, should always be ascertained by thee. Theking, even if he be powerful, should trust them that are weak, for inmoments of heedlessness the weak may assail the powerful like a flock ofvultures seizing their prey. A man of sinful soul seeks to injure hismaster even if the latter be sweet-speeched and possessed of everyaccomplishment. Do not, therefore, place thy confidence upon such men.Nahusha's son Yayati, in declaring the mysteries of king-craft, said thata person engaged in ruling men should slay even foes that arecontemptible.'\"\n",

They that dwell inKurukshetra which lieth to the south of the Saraswati and the north ofthe Drishadwati, are said to dwell in heaven. O hero, one should residethere, O thou foremost of warriors, for a month. There, O lord of earth,the gods with Brahma at their head, the Rishis, the Siddhas, theCharanas, the Gandharvas, the Apsaras, the Yakshas and the Nagas, oftenrepair, O Bharata, to the highly sacred Brahmakshetra.

Residing there without food for one night, one obtaineth thestatus called Ganapatya. There, O king, is the celebrated tirtha calledYakshini. O king, repairing to that tirtha and bathing there, oneobtaineth fruition of all his desires. O bull of the Bharata race, thattirtha is regarded as the gate of Kurukshetra. The pilgrim should withconcentrated soul, walk round it. Equal unto the Pushkaras, it wascreated by the high-souled Rama, the son of Jamadagni. Bathing there andworshipping the Pitris and the gods, one obtaineth, O king, the merit ofthe horse-sacrifice and becometh successful in everything. The pilgrimshould next repair with concentrated soul to the Rama-hrada. There, Oking, the heroic Rama of resplendent energy, exterminating the Kshatriyasby his might, dug five lakes and filled them, O tiger among men, with theblood of his victims, as heard by us. And having filled those lakes withKshatriya blood, Rama offered oblations of blood to his sires andgrandsires. Gratified (with the oblations) those Rishis then addressedRama and said, 'O Rama, O Rama, O thou of great good fortune, we havebeen gratified with thee, O thou of the Bhrigu race, for this thy regardfor the Pitris, and thy prowess, O exalted one! Blessed be thou and askthou the boon thou choosest. What is that thou desirest, O thou of greatsplendour!' Thus addressed (by them), Rama, that foremost of smiters,said with joined hands these words unto the Pitris, stationed in thefirmament, 'If ye have been gratified with me, if I have deserved yourfavour, I desire this favour of the Pitris, viz., that I may havepleasure again in ascetic austerities. Let me also, through your power,be freed from the sin I have committed by exterminating, from wrath, theKshatriya race. Let also my lakes become tirthas celebrated over theworld. The Pitris, hearing these blessed words of Rama, were highlygratified, and filled with joy they answered him saying, 'Let thyasceticism increase in consequence of thy regard for the Pitris. Thouhast exterminated the Kshatriyas from wrath. Freed art thou already fromthat sin, for they have perished as a consequence of their own misdeeds.Without doubt, these lakes of thine will become tirthas. And if one,bathing in these lakes, offereth oblations of the water thereof to thePitris, the latter gratified with him will grant him desire, difficult offulfilment in the world as also eternal heaven.' O king, having grantedhim these boons, the Pitris joyfully saluted Rama of the Bhrigu race anddisappeared there and then. It was thus that the lakes of the illustriousRama of the Bhrigu race became sacred. Leading a Brahmacharya mode oflife and observing sacred vows, one should bathe in the lakes of Rama.Bathing therein and worshipping Rama, one obtaineth, O king, the merit ofgift of gold in abundance.

O king, ithath been heard by us that in days of old Mankanaka having cut his handwith the pointed blade of the Kusa grass, there flowed from his woundvegetable juice (instead of blood). And beholding vegetable juice flowfrom his wound, the Rishi began to dance with wonder-expanded eyes. Andas the Rishi danced, all the mobile and immobile creatures also,overwhelmed with his prowess, began to dance with him. Then, O king, thegods with Brahma at their head and Rishis endued with the wealth ofasceticism moved by the act of Mankanaka, represented the matter toMahadeva, saying, 'It behoveth thee, O god, to act in such a way thatthis Rishi may not dance.' Thus addressed, Mahadeva, with heart filledwith joy, approached the dancing Rishi, and moved by the desire of doinggood to the gods, said, 'O great Rishi, O virtuous one, why dost thoudance? O bull among Munis, what can be the reason of this thy presentjoy?' The Rishi answered, 'O best of Brahmanas, I am an ascetic thattread the path of virtue. Dost thou not behold, O Brahmana, thatvegetable juice floweth from the wound in my hand? Filled with great joyat sight of this, I am dancing.' Addressing the Rishi blinded by emotion,the god laughingly said, 'O Brahmana, I do not wonder at this. Beholdme.' Having said this, O best of men, Mahadeva, O sinless king, pressedhis thumb by the tip of his own finger. And, lo, from the wound thusinflicted, there came out ashes white as snow. And beholding this, Oking, that Muni became ashamed and fell at the feet of the god. Andbelieving that there was nothing better and greater than the god Rudra,he began to adore him in these words:\"O holder of the trident, thou art the refuge of the celestials and theAsuras, of, indeed, the universe. By thee have been created the threeworlds with their mobile and immobile beings. It is thou again thatswallowest everything at the end of the Yuga. Thou art incapable of beingknown by the gods themselves, far less by me. O sinless one, the godswith Brahma at their heads are all displayed in thee. Thou art all, theCreator himself and the Ordainer of the worlds. It is by thy grace thatall the gods sport without anxiety or fear. And adoring Mahadeva thus theRishi also said, 'O god of gods, grant me thy grace, so that myasceticism may not diminish.' Then that god of cheerful soul answered theregenerate Rishi,--saying, 'Let thy asceticism, O Brahmana, increase athousandfold through my grace. And, O great Muni, I shall dwell with theein this thy asylum. Bathing in Saptasaraswata, they that will worship me,shall be able to attain everything here and hereafter. And, withoutdoubt, they shall all attain to the Saraswata region in the end.' Havingsaid this, Mahadeva disappeared then and there.\"After visiting Saraswata, one should proceed to Ausanasa celebrated overthe three worlds. There, O Bharata, the gods with Brahma at their head,and Rishis endued with wealth of asceticism, and the illustriousKartikeya, were ever present during two twilights and the mid-day,impelled by the desire of doing good to Bhargava. There in that tirtha isanother called Kapalamochana, which cleanseth from every sin. O tigeramong men, bathing there one is cleansed from every sin. One should thenproceed to the tirtha called Agni. Bathing there, O bull among men, oneobtaineth the regions of agni and raiseth his own race (from lowerregions). There in that tirtha is another, O chief of the Bharatas, thatbelongeth to Viswamitra. Bathing there, O best of men, one obtaineth thestatus of a Brahmana. Proceeding next to Brahmayoni in purity of body andwith subdued soul, one obtaineth, O tiger among men, by bathing there,the abode of Brahma, and sanctifieth, without doubt, his own race to theseventh generation up and down. One should next proceed, O king, to thetirtha celebrated over the three worlds, which is called Prithudaka,belonging to Kartikeya. One should bathe there and occupy oneself in theworship of the Pitris and the gods. Whatever evil hath been committed,knowingly or unknowingly, by man or woman, impelled by human motives, isall destroyed, O Bharata, by a bath in that tirtha. Bathing there oneobtaineth, too, the merit of the horse-sacrifice and heaven also. Thelearned have said that Kurukshetra is holy; that holier than Kurukshetrais the Saraswati; that holier than the Saraswati are all the tirthastogether, and that holier than all the tirthas together is Prithudaka. Hethat engaged in the recitation of prayers casteth off his body atPrithudaka, which is the best of all tirthas, becometh an immortal. Ithath been sung by Sanatkumara and by the high-souled Vyasa, and it is inthe Vedas also, that one should, O king, go to Prithudaka, with subduedsoul. O son of Kuru race, there is no tirtha which is superior toPrithudaka. Without doubt, that tirtha is purifying, holy andsin-destroying. O best of men, it hath been said by learned persons thatmen, however sinful, by bathing in Prithudaka, go to heaven. O best ofthe Bharatas, there in that tirtha is another called Madhusrava. Bathingthere, O king, one obtaineth the merit of giving away a thousand kine.One should then proceed, O king, to that celebrated and sacred tirthawhere the Saraswati uniteth with the Aruna. One that batheth there,having fasted for three nights, is cleansed of even the sin of slaying aBrahmana, and obtaineth also merit that is superior to that of either theAgnishtoma or Atiratra sacrifice, and rescueth his race to the seventhgeneration up and down. There in that tirtha is another, O perpetuator ofthe Kuru race, that is called Ardhakila. From compassion for theBrahmanas, that tirtha was made by Darbhi in days of old. Without doubt,by vows, by investiture of the sacred, by fasts, by rites and by Mantras,one becometh a Brahmana. O bull among men, it hath been seen, however, bylearned persons of old that even one destitute of rites and Mantras, byonly bathing in that tirtha becometh learned and endued with the merit ofvows. Darbhi had also brought hither the four oceans. O best of men, onethat batheth here, never meeteth with distress hereafter and obtainethalso the merit of giving away four thousand kine. One should next repair,O virtuous one, to the tirtha called Satasahasraka. Near to this isanother called Sahasraka. Both are celebrated, and one that batheth inthem, obtaineth the merit of giving away a thousand kine. Fasts and giftsthere multiply a thousandfold. One should next proceed, O king, to theexcellent tirtha called Renuka. One should bathe there and worship thePitris and the gods. By this, cleansed from every sin, he obtaineth themerit of the Agnishtoma sacrifice. Bathing next in the tirtha calledVimochana with passions and senses under control, one is cleansed fromall the sins generated by the acceptance of gifts. With senses undercontrol and practising the Brahmacharya mode of life, one should nextrepair to the woods of Panchavati. By a sojourn thither, one earneth muchvirtue and becometh adored in the regions of the virtuous. One shouldnext go to the tirtha of Varuna called Taijasa, blazing in effulgence ofits own. There in that tirtha is the lord of Yoga, Sthanu himself, havingfor his vehicle the bull. He that sojourneth there, obtaineth success byworshipping the god of gods. It was there that the gods with Brahma attheir head and Rishis endued with wealth of asceticism, installed Guha asthe generalissimo of the celestials. To the east of that tirtha isanother, O perpetuator of Kuru race, that is called Kuru tirtha. Withsenses under control and leading a Brahmacharya mode of life, he thatbathes in Kuru-tirtha, becometh cleansed of all his sins and obtaineththe region of Brahma. With subdued senses and regulated diet one shouldnext proceed to Svargadwara. Sojourning thither, one obtaineth the meritof the Agnishtoma sacrifice and goeth to the abode of Brahma. The pilgrimshould then, O king, proceed to the tirtha called Anaraka. Bathing there,O king, one never meeteth with distress hereafter. There, O king, Brahmahimself with the other gods having Narayana at their head, is everpresent, O tiger among men! And, O royal son of the Kuru race, the wifealso of Rudra is present there. Beholding the goddess, one never meetethwith distress hereafter. There in that tirtha O king, is also (an imageof) Visweswara, the lord of Uma. Beholding the god of gods there, one iscleansed of all his sins. Beholding also (the image of) Narayana fromwhose navel had sprung the lotus, one blazeth forth, O royal represser ofall foes, and goeth to the abode of Vishnu. O bull among men, he thatbatheth in the tirthas of all the gods, is exempted from every sorrow andblazeth forth like the Moon. The pilgrim should next proceed, O king, toSwastipura. By walking around that place, one obtaineth the merit ofgiving away a thousand kine. Arriving next at the tirtha called Pavana,one should offer oblations to the Pitris and the gods. By this, heobtaineth, O Bharata, the merit of the Agnishtoma sacrifice. Near to thatis Ganga-hrada, and another, O Bharata, called Kupa. Thirty millions oftirthas, O king, are present in that Kupa. Bathing there, O king, aperson obtaineth heaven. Bathing also in the Ganga-hrada and adoringMaheswara, one obtaineth the status of Ganapatya and rescueth his ownrace. One should next proceed to Sthanuvata, celebrated over the threeworlds. Bathing there, O king, one obtaineth heaven. One should thenproceed to Vadaripachana, the asylum of Vasishtha. Having tasted therefor three nights, one should eat jujubes. He that liveth on jujubes fortwelve years, and he that fasteth at the tirtha for three nights,acquireth merit that is eternal. Arriving then at Indramarga, O king, andfasting there for a day and night the pilgrim becometh adored in theabode of Indra. Arriving next at the tirtha called Ekaratra, a personthat stayeth there for one night, with regulated vows and refraining fromuntruth, becometh adored in the abode of Brahma. One should next go, Oking, to the asylum of Aditya--that illustrious god who is a mass ofeffulgence. Bathing in that tirtha celebrated over three worlds, andworshipping the god of light, one goeth to the region of Aditya andrescueth his own race. The pilgrim then, O king, bathing in the tirtha ofSoma, obtaineth, without doubt, the region of Soma. One should nextproceed, O virtuous one, to the most sacred tirtha of the illustriousDadhicha, that sanctifying tirtha which is celebrated over the wholeworld. It was here that Angiras, that ocean of ascetic austeritiesbelonging to the Saraswata race, was born, Bathing in that tirtha, oneobtaineth the merit of the horse-sacrifice, and without doubt, gainethalso residence in the legion of Saraswati. With subdued senses andleading a Brahmacharya mode of life, one should next proceed toKanyasrama. Residing there for three nights, O king, with subdued sensesand regulated diet, one obtaineth a hundred celestial damsels and goethalso to the abode of Brahma. One should next, O virtuous one, proceed tothe tirtha called Sannihati. Sojourning thither the gods with Brahma attheir head and Rishis endued with wealth of asceticism earn much virtue.Bathing in the Saraswati during a solar eclipse, one obtaineth the meritof a hundred horse-sacrifices, and any sacrifice that one may performthere produceth merit that is eternal. Whatever tirthas exist on earth orin the firmament, all the rivers, lakes, smaller lakes, springs, tanks,large and small, and spots sacred to particular gods, without doubt, allcome, O tiger among men, month after month, and mingle with Sannihati, Oking of men! And it is because that all other tirthas are united togetherhere, that this tirtha is so called. Bathing there and drinking of itswater, one becometh adored in heaven. Listen now, O king, to the meritacquired by that mortal who performeth a Sraddha on the day of the newmoon during a solar eclipse. The person that performeth a Sraddha there,after having bathed in that tirtha, obtaineth the merit that one earnethby properly celebrating a thousand horse-sacrifices. Whatever sins a manor woman committeth, are, without doubt, all destroyed as soon as onebatheth in that tirtha. Bathing there one also ascendeth to the abode ofBrahma on the lotus-coloured tar. Bathing next in Koti-tirtha, afterhaving worshipped the Yaksha doorkeeper, Machakruka, one obtaineth themerit of giving away gold in abundance. Near to this, O best of theBharatas, is a tirtha called Gangahrada. One should bathe there, Ovirtuous one, with subdued soul and leading a Brahmacharya mode of life.By this, one obtaineth merit that is greater than that of a Rajasuya andhorse-sacrifices. The tirtha called Naimisha is productive of good onearth. Pushkara is productive of good in the regions of the firmament;Kurukshetra, however, is productive of good in respect of all the threeworlds. Even the dust of Kurukshetra, carried by the wind, leadeth sinfulmen to a highly blessed state. They that reside in Kurukshetra, whichlieth to the north of the Drishadwati and the south of the Saraswati,really reside in heaven. 'I will go to Kurukshetra,' 'I will dwell inKurukshetra,' he that uttereth those words even once, becometh cleansedof all sins. The sacred Kurukshetra which is worshipped by Brahmarshis,is regarded as the sacrificial altar of the celestials. Those mortalsthat dwell there, have nothing to grieve for at any time. That whichlieth between Tarantuka and Arantuka and the lakes of Rama and Machakrukais Kurukshetra. It is also called Samantapanchaka and is said to be thenorthern sacrificial altar of the Grandsire.'\n",

      " CLVIIVaisampayana continued, \"On that Rakshasa having been slain, that lord,the royal son of Kunti, returned to the hermitage of Narayana and beganto dwell there. And once on a time, remembering his brother Jaya(Arjuna), Yudhishthira summoned all his brothers, together with Draupadiand said these words, 'We have passed these four years peacefully rangingthe woods. It hath been appointed by Vibhatsu that about the fifth yearhe will come to that monarch of mountains, the excellent cliff Sweta,ever graced with festivities held by blooming plants and maddened Kokilasand black bees, and peacocks, and chatakas and inhabited by tigers, andboars and buffaloes, and gavayas, and deer, and ferocious beasts; andsacred; and lovely with blown lotuses of a hundred and a thousand petals,and blooming lilies and blue lilies and frequented by the celestials andthe Asuras. And we also, eagerly anxious of meeting him on his arrivalhave made up our minds to repair thither. Partha of unrivalled prowesshath appointed with me, saying, 'I shall remain abroad for five years,with the object of learning military science.' In the place like unto theregion of the gods, shall we behold the wielder of Gandiva, arrive afterhaving obtained the weapons.' Having said this, the Pandava summoned theBrahmanas, and the sons of Pritha having gone round the ascetics of rigidausterities and thereby pleased them, informed them of the mattermentioned above. Thereupon the Brahmanas gave their assent, saying, 'Thisshall be attended by prosperity and welfare. O foremost of the Bharatas,these troubles shall result in happiness. O pious one, gaining the earthby the Kshatriya virtue, thou shall govern it.' Then in obedience tothese words of the ascetics, that represser of foes, Yudhishthira, setout with his brothers and those Brahmanas, followed by the Rakshasa andprotected by Lomasa. And that one of mighty energy, and of staunch vows,with his brothers, at places went on foot and at others were carried bythe Rakshasas. Then king Yudhishthira, apprehending many troubles,proceeded towards the north abounding in lions and tigers and elephants.And beholding on the way the mountain Mainaka and the base of theGandhamadana and that rocky mass Sweta and many a crystal rivulet higherand higher up the mountain, he reached on the seventeenth day the sacredslopes of the Himalayas. And, O king, not far from the Gandhamadana,Pandu's son beheld on the sacred slopes of the Himavan covered withvarious trees and creepers the holy hermitage of Vrishaparva surroundedby blossoming trees growing near the cascades. And when those repressersof foes, the sons of Pandu, had recovered from fatigue, they went to theroyal sage, the pious Vrishaparva and greeted him. And that royal sagereceived with affection those foremost of Bharatas, even as his own sons.And those repressers of foes passed there seven nights, duly regarded.And when the eighth day came, taking the permission of that sagecelebrated over the worlds, they prepared to start on their journey. Andhaving one by one introduced unto Vrishaparva those Brahmanas, who, dulyhonoured, remained in his charge as friends; and having also entrustedthe highsouled Vrishaparva with their remaining robes, the sons of Pandu,O king, left in the hermitage of Vrishaparva their sacrificial vesselstogether with their ornaments and jewels. And wise and pious and versedin every duty and having a knowledge of the past as well as the future,that one gave instructions unto those best of the Bharatas, as unto hisown sons. Then taking his permission those high-souled ones set outtowards the north. And as they set out the magnanimous Vrishaparvafollowed them to a certain distance. Then having entrusted the Pandavasunto the care of the Brahmanas and instructed and blessed them and givendirections concerning their course, Vrishaparva of mighty energy retracedhis steps.\"Then Kunti's son, Yudhishthira of unfailing prowess, together with hisbrothers, began to proceed on foot along the mountain path, inhabited byvarious kinds of beasts. And having dwelt at the mountain slopes, denselyovergrown with trees, Pandu's son on the fourth day reached the Swetamountain, like unto a mighty mass of clouds, abounding in streams andconsisting of a mass of gold and gems. And taking the way directed byVrishaparva, they reached one by one the intended places, beholdingvarious mountains. And over and over they passed with ease manyinaccessible rocks and exceedingly impassable caves of the mountain. AndDhaumya and Krishna and the Parthas and the mighty sage Lomasa went on ina body and none grew tired. And those highly fortunate ones arrived atthe sacred and mighty mountain resounding with the cries of birds andbeasts and covered with various trees and creepers and inhabited bymonkeys, and romantic and furnished with many lotus-lakes and havingmarshes and extensive forests. And then with their down standing erect,they saw the mountain Gandhamadana, the abode of Kimpurushas, frequentedby Siddhas and Charanas and ranged by Vidyadharis and Kinnaris andinhabited by herds of elephants and thronged with lions and tigers andresounding with the roars of Sarabhas and attended by various beasts. Andthe war-like sons of Pandu gradually entered into the forest of theGandhamadana, like unto the Nandana gardens, delightful to the mind andheart and worthy of being inhabited and having beautiful groves. And asthose heroes entered with Draupadi and the high-souled Brahmanas, theyheard notes uttered by the mouths of birds, exceedingly sweet andgraceful to the ear and causing delight and dulcet and broken by reasonof excess of animal spirits. And they saw various trees bending under theweight of fruits in all seasons, and ever bright with flowers--such asmangoes and hog-plums and bhavyas and pomegranates, citrons and jacks andlakuchas and plantains and aquatic reeds and parvatas and champakas andlovely kadamvas and vilwas, wood-apples and rose-apples and kasmaris andjujbes and figs and glomerous figs and banians and aswatthas and khirikasand bhall atakas and amalkas and bibhitakas and ingudas and karamardasand tindukas of large fruits--these and many others on the slopes of theGandhamadana, clustered with sweet and nectarine fruits. And besidesthese, they beheld champakas and asokas and ketakas and vakulas andpunnagas and saptaparnas and karnikaras, and patals, and beautifulkutajas and mandaras, and lotuses, and parijatas, and kovidaras anddevadarus, and salas, and palmyra palms, and tamalas, and pippalas, andsalmalis and kinsukas, and singsapas, and saralas and these wereinhabited by Chakoras, and wood-peckers and chatakas, and various otherbirds, singing in sweet tones pleasing to the ear. And they saw lakesbeautiful on all sides with aquatic birds, and covered all around withkumudas, and pundarikas, and kokanadas, and utpalas, and kalharas, andkamalas and thronged on all sides with drakes and ruddy geese, andospreys, and gulls and karandavas, and plavas, and swans, and cranes, andshags, and other aquatic birds. And those foremost of men saw thoselotus-lakes beautified with assemblages of lotuses, and ringing with thesweet hum of bees, glad, and drowsy on account of having drunk theintoxicating honey of lotuses, and reddened with the farina falling fromthe lotuscups. And in the groves they beheld with their hens peacocksmaddened with desire caused by the notes of cloud-trumpets; and thosewoods-loving glad peacocks drowsy with desire, were dancing, spreading indalliance their gorgeous tails, and were crying in melodious notes. Andsome of the peacocks were sporting with their mates on kutaja treescovered with creepers. And some sat on the boughs of the kutajas,spreading their gorgeous tails, and looking like crowns worn by thetrees. And in the glades they beheld the graceful sindhuvaras like untothe darts of Cupid. And on the summits of the mountain, they saw bloomingkarnikaras bearing blossoms of a golden hue, appearing like ear-rings ofexcellent make. And in the forest they saw blossoming kuruvakas, likeunto the shafts of Cupid, which smiteth one with desire and maketh himuneasy. And they saw tilakas appearing like unto beauty-spots painted onthe forehead of the forest. And they saw mango trees graced with blossomshummed over by black bees, and serving the purpose of Cupid's shafts. Andon the slopes of the mountain there were diverse blossoming trees,looking lovely, some bearing flowers of a golden hue, and some, of thehue of the forest-conflagration, and some, red and some sable, and somegreen like unto lapises. And besides these, there were ranges of salasand tamalas and patalas and vakula trees, like unto garlands put on bythe summits of mountain. Thus gradually beholding on the slopes of themountain many lakes, looking transparent like crystal, and having swansof white plumage and resounding with cries of cranes, and filled withlotuses and lilies, and furnished with waters of delicious feel; and alsobeholding fragrant flowers, and luscious fruits, and romantic lakes, andcaptivating trees, the Pandavas penetrated into the forest with eyesexpanded with wonder. And (as they proceeded) they were fanned by thebreeze of balmy feel, and perfumed by kamalas and utpalas and kalharasand pundarikas. Then Yudhishthira pleasantly spake unto Bhima saying,'Ah! O Bhima, beautiful is this forest of the Gandhamadana. In thisromantic forest there are various heavenly blossoming wild trees andcreepers, bedecked with foliage and fruit, nor are there any trees thatdo not flower. On these slopes of the Gandhamadana, all the trees are ofsleek foliage and fruit. And behold how these lotus-lakes with fullblownlotuses, and ringing with the hum of black bees, are being agitated byelephants with their mates. Behold another lotus-lake girt with lines oflotuses, like unto a second Sree in an embodied form wearing garlands.And in this excellent forest there are beautiful ranges of woods, richwith the aroma of various blossoms, and hummed over by the black bees.And, O Bhima, behold on all sides the excellent sporting ground of thecelestials. By coming here, we have attained extra-human state, and beenblessed. O Partha, on these slopes of the Gandhamadana, yon beautifulblossoming trees, being embraced by creepers with blossoms at their tops,look lovely. And, O Bhima, hark unto the notes of the peacocks cryingwith their hens on the mountain slopes. And birds such as chakoras, andsatapatras, and maddened kokilas, and parrots, are alighting on theseexcellent flowering trees. And sitting on the twigs, myriads ofjivajivakas of scarlet, yellow and red hues, are looking at one another.And the cranes are seen near the spots covered with green and reddishgrass, and also by the side of the cascades. And those birds,bhringarajas, and upachakras, and herons are pouring forth their notescharming to all creatures. And, lo! with their mates, these elephantsfurnished with four tusks, and white as lotuses, are agitating that largelake of the hue of lapises. And from many cascades, torrents high asseveral palmyra palms (placed one upon another) are rushing down from thecliffs. And many argent minerals splendid, and of the effulgence of thesun, and like unto autumnal clouds, are beautifying this mighty mountain.And in some places there are minerals of the hue of the collyrium, and insome those like unto gold, in some, yellow orpiment and in some,vermilion, and in some, caves of red arsenic like unto the evening cloudsand in some, red chalk of the hue of the rabit, and in some, mineralslike unto white and sable clouds; and in some, those effulgent as therising sun, these minerals of great lustre beautify the mountain. OPartha, as was said by Vrishaparva, the Gandharvas and the Kimpurushas,in company with their loves, are visible on the summits of the mountain.And, O Bhima, there are heard various songs of appropriate measures, andalso Vedic hymns, charming to all creatures. Do thou behold the sacredand graceful celestial river Mahaganga, with swans, resorted to by sagesand Kinnaras. And, O represser of foes, see this mountain havingminerals, rivulets, and beautiful woods and beasts, and snakes of diverseshapes and a hundred heads and Kinnaras, Gandharvas and Apsaras.'\"Vaisampayana said, \"Having attained excellent state, those valiant andwarlike repressers of foes with Draupadi and the high-souled Brahmanaswere exceedingly delighted at heart, and they were not satiated bybeholding that monarch of mountains. Thereafter they saw the hermitage ofthe royal sage Arshtishena, furnished with flowers and trees bearingfruits. Then they went to Arshtishena versed in all duties of rigidausterities, skeleton-like, and having muscles bare.\"\n",

Then the foremost of the sons of Pandu, by performing featsexcelling in fierceness, defeated the virtuous and mighty kingDirghayaghna of Ayodhya. And the exalted one then subjugated the countryof Gopalakaksha and the northern Kosalas and also the king of Mallas. Andthe mighty one, arriving then in the moist region at the foot of theHimalayas soon brought the whole country under his sway. And that bull ofBharata race brought under control in this way diverse countries. Andendued with great energy and in strength the foremost of all strong men,the son of Pandu next conquered the country of Bhallata, as also themountain of Suktimanta that was by the side of Bhallata. Then Bhima ofterrible prowess and long arms, vanquishing in battle the unretreatingSuvahu the king of Kasi, brought him under complete sway. Then that bullamong the sons of Pandu overcame in battle, by sheer force, the greatking Kratha reigning in the region lying about Suparsa. Then the hero ofgreat energy vanquished the Matsya and the powerful Maladas and thecountry called Pasubhumi that was without fear or oppression of any kind.And the long-armed hero then, coming from that land, conquered Madahara,Mahidara, and the Somadheyas, and turned his steps towards the north. Andthe mighty son of Kunti then subjugated, by sheer force, the countrycalled Vatsabhumi, and the king of the Bhargas, as also the ruler of theNishadas and Manimat and numerous other kings. Then Bhima, with scarcelyany degree of exertion and very soon, vanquished the southern Mallas andthe Bhagauanta mountains. And the hero next vanquished, by policy alone,the Sarmakas and the Varmakas. And that tiger among men then defeatedwith comparative ease that lord of earth, Janaka the king of the Videhas.And the hero then subjugated strategically the Sakas and the barbariansliving in that part of the country. And the son of Pandu, sending forthexpeditions from Videha, conquered the seven kings of the Kiratas livingabout the Indra mountain. The mighty hero then, endued with abundantenergy, vanquished in battle the Submas and the Prasuhmas. And winningthem over to his side, the son of Kunti, possessed of great strength,marched against Magadha. On his way he subjugated the monarchs known bythe names of Danda and Dandadhara, And accompanied by those monarchs, theson of Pandu marched against Girivraja. After bringing the son ofJarasandha under his sway by conciliation and making him pay tribute, thehero then accompanied by the monarchs he had vanquished, marched againstKansa. And making the earth tremble by means of his troops consisting ofthe four kinds of forces, the foremost of the Pandavas then encounteredKarna that slayer of foes. And, O Bharata, having subjugated Karna andbrought him under his sway, the mighty hero then vanquished the powerfulking of the mountainous regions. And the son of Pandu then slew in afierce encounter, by the strength of his arms, the mighty king who dweltin Madagiri. And the Pandava then, O king, subjugated in battle thosestrong and brave heroes of fierce prowess, viz., the heroic and mightyVasudeva, the king of Pundra and king Mahaujah who reigned inKausika-kachchha, and then attacked the king of Vanga. And havingvanquished Samudrasena and king Chandrasena and Tamralipta, and also theking of the Karvatas and the ruler of the Suhmas, as also the kings thatdwelt on the sea-shore, that bull among the Bharatas then conquered allMlechchha tribes. The mighty son of the wind-god having thus conqueredvarious countries, and exacting tributes from them all advanced towardsLohity. And the son of Pandu then made all the Mlechchha kings dwellingin the marshy regions on the sea-coast, pay tributes and various kinds ofwealth, and sandal wood and aloes, and clothes and gems, and pearls andblankets and gold and silver and valuable corals. The Mlechchha kingsshowered upon the illustrious son of Kunti a thick downpour of wealthconsisting of coins and gems counted by hundreds of millions. Thenreturning to Indraprastha, Bhima of terrible prowess offered the whole ofthat wealth unto king Yudhisthira the just.\"\n",

      " CCCVII'\"Janaka said, Thou hast, O foremost of Rishis, said that Unity is theattribute of that which is Akshara (Indestructible) and variety ormultiplicity is the attribute of what is known as Kshara (Destructible).I have not, however, clearly understood the nature of these two. Doubtsare still lurking in my mind. Ignorant men look upon the Soul as enduedwith the incident of multiplicity. They, however that are possessed ofknowledge and wisdom regard the Soul to be one and the same. I how-ever,have a very dull understanding. I am, therefore, unable to comprehend howall this can happen. The causes also that thou hast assigned for theunity and the multiplicity of Akshara and Kshara I have almost forgottenin consequence of the restlessness of my understanding. I therefore,desire to hear thee once more discourse to me on those same incidents ofunity and multiplicity, on him who is knowing, on what is destitute ofknowledge, on Jiva-soul, Knowledge, Ignorance. Akshara, Kshara, and onthe Sankhya and the Yoga systems, in detail and separately and agreeableto the truth.\"'Vasishtha said, I shall tell thee what thou askest! Listen however, tome, O monarch, as I expound to thee the practices of Yoga separately.Contemplation, which constitutes an obligatory practices with Yogins, istheir highest puissance[1619]. Those conversant with Yoga say thatContemplation is of two kinds. One is the concentration of the mind, andthe other is called Pranayama (regulation of breath). Pranayama is saidto be endued with substance; while concentration of mind is unendued withit.[1620] Excepting the three times when a man passes urine and stoolsand eats, one should devote the whole of his time to contemplation.With-drawing the senses from their objects by the aid of the mind, onepossessed of intelligence, having made oneself pure, should agreeably tothe two and twenty modes of transmitting the Prana breath, unite theJiva-soul with That which transcends the four and twentieth topic (calledIgnorance or Prakriti)[1621] which is regarded by the wise as dwelling inevery part of the body and as transcending decay and destruction. It isby means of those two and twenty methods that the Soul may always beknown, as heard by us. It is certain that this practice of Yoga is hiswhose mind is never affected by evil passions. It is not any otherperson's. Dissociated from all attachments, abstemious in diet, andsubduing all the senses, one should fix one's mind on the Soul, duringthe first and the last part of the night, after having, O king ofMithila, suspended the functions of the senses, quieted the mind by theunderstanding, and assumed a posture as motionless as that of a block ofstone. When men of knowledge, conversant with the rules of Yoga, becomeas fixed as a stake of wood, and as immovable as a mountain, then arethey said to be in Yoga. When one does not hear, and smell, and taste,and see; when one is not conscious of any touch; when one's mind becomesperfectly free from every purpose; when one is not conscious of anything, when one cherishes no thought; when one becomes like a piece ofwood, then is one called by the wise to be in perfect Yoga. At such atime one shines like a lamp that burns in a place where there is no wind;at such a time one becomes freed even from one's subtile form, andperfectly united with Brahma. When one attains to such progress, one hasno longer to ascend or to fall among intermediate beings. When personslike ourselves say that there has been a complete identification of theKnower, the Known, and K now-ledge, then is the Yogin said to behold theSupreme Soul.[1622] While in Yoga, the Supreme Soul displays itself inthe Yogin's heart like a blazing fire, or like the bright Sun, or likethe lightning's flame in the sky. That Supreme Soul which is Unborn andwhich is the essence of nectar, that is seen by high-souled Brahmanasendued with intelligence and wisdom and conversant with the Vedas, issubtiler than what is subtile and greater than what is great. That Soul,though dwelling in all creatures, is not seen by them. The creator of theworlds, He is seen only by a person endued with wealth of intelligencewhen aided by the lamp of the mind. He dwells on the other share of thickDarkness and transcends him called Iswara.[1623] Persons conversant withthe Vedas and endued with omniscience call Him the dispeller of Darkness,stainless, transcending Darkness, without attributes and endued therewith.\"'This is what is called the Yoga of Yogins. What else is the indicationof Yoga? By such practices do Yogins succeeded in beholding the SupremeSoul that transcends destruction and decay. This much that I have toldthee in detail concerns about the science of Yoga. I shall now discourseto thee of that Sankhya philosophy by which the Supreme Soul is seenthrough the gradual destruction of errors.[1624] The Sankhyas, whosesystem is built on Prakriti, say that Prakriti, which is Unmanifest, isthe foremost. From Prakriti, they say, O monarch, the second principlecalled Mahat, is produced. It is heard by us that from Mahat flows thethird principle called Consciousness. The Sankhyas blessed with sight ofthe Soul say that from Consciousness flow the five subtile essence ofsound, form, touch, taste, and scent. All these eight they call by thename of Prakriti. The modifications of these eight are sixteen in number.They are the five gross essence of space, light, earth, water, and wind,and the ten senses of action and of knowledge including the mind. Men ofwisdom devoted to the Sankhya path and conversant with all its ordinancesand dispensations regard these four and twenty topics as embracing thewhole range of Sankhya enquiry. That which is produced becomes merged inthe producing. Created by the Supreme Soul one after another, theseprinciples are destroyed in a reverse order. At every new Creation, theGunas start into existence in the lateral order (as stated above), and(when Destruction comes) they merge, (each into its progenitor) in areverse order, like the waves of the ocean disappearing in the ocean thatgives them birth. O best of kings, this is the manner in which theCreation and the Destruction of Prakriti takes place. The Supreme Beingis all that remains when Universal Destruction takes place, and it is Hethat assumes multifarious forms when Creation starts into life. This iseven so, O king, as ascertained by men of knowledge. It is Prakriti thatcauses the Overpresiding Purusha to thus assume diversity and revert backto unity. Prakriti also herself has the same indications. Only fullyconversant with the nature of the topics of enquiry knows that Prakritialso assumes the same kind of diversity and unity, for when Destructioncomes she reverts into unity and when Creation flows she assumesdiversity of form. The Soul makes Prakriti, which contains the principlesof production or growth, to assume manifold forms. Prakriti is calledKshetra (or soil). Transcending the four and twenty topics or principlesis the Soul which is great. It presides over that Prakriti or Kshetra.Hence, O great king, the foremost of Yatis say that the Soul is thePresider. Indeed, it has been heard by us that in consequence of theSoul's presiding over all Kshetras He is called the Presider. And becauseHe knows that Unmanifest Kshetra, He is, therefore, also calledKshetrajna (Knower of Kshetra). And because also the Soul enters intoUnmanifest Kshetra (viz., the body), therefore he is called Purusha.Kshetra is something quite different from Kshetrajna. Kshetra isUnmanifest. The Soul, which transcends the four and twenty principles, iscalled the Knower. Knowledge and the object known are different from eachother. Knowledge, again, has been said to be Unmanifest, while the objectof knowledge is the Soul which transcends the four and twenty principles.The Unmanifest is called Kshetra. Sattwa (understanding), and also Iswara(the supreme Lord), while Purusha, which is the twenty-fifth principlehas nothing superior to it and is not a principle (for it transcends allprinciples and is only called a principle conventionally). This much Oking, is an account of the Sankhya philosophy. The Sankhyas called thecause of the universe, and merging all the grosser principles into theChit behold the Supreme Soul. Rightly studying the four and twenty topicsalong with Prakriti, and ascertaining their true nature, the Sankhyassucceed in beholding That which transcends the four and twenty topics orprinciples.[1625] Jiva in reality is that very Soul which transcendsPrakriti and is beyond the four and twenty topics. When he succeeds inknowing that Supreme Soul by dissociating himself from Prakriti, he thenbecomes identifiable with the Supreme Soul. I have now told thee everything about the Sankhya System truly. Those who are conversant with thisphilosophy succeed in attaining are subject to error have directcognisance of Brahma. They that succeed in attaining to tranquillity.Indeed, as men whose understanding are subject to error have directcognisance of Brahma. They that succeed in attaining to that state havenever to come back to this world after the dissolution of their bodies;while as regards those that are said to be emancipate in this life,puissance, and that indescribable felicity which attaches itself toSamadhi, and immutability, become theirs, in consequence of their havingattained to the nature of the Indestructible.[1626] They who behold thisuniverse as many (instead of seeing it as one and uniform) are said tosee incorrectly. These men are blind to Brahma. O chastiser of foes, suchpersons have repeatedly to come back into the world and assume bodies (indiverse orders of Being). They who are conversant with all that has beensaid above become possessed of omniscience, and accordingly when theypass from this body no longer become subject to the control of any morephysical frames. All things, (or the entire universe), have been said tobe the result of the Unmanifest. The Soul, which is the twenty-fifth,transcends all things. They who know the Soul have no fear of returningto the world.'\"\n",

      " CXIVSanjaya said, \"Hearing these words of the high-souled Drona, Bhagadattaand Kripa and Salya and Kritavarman, and Vinda and Anuvinda of Avanti,and Jayadratha the ruler of the Sindhus, and Chitrasena and Vikarna andDurmarshana and others, these ten warriors of thy army, supported by alarge host consisting of many nationalities, fought with Bhimasena,desirous of winning high renown in the battle for Bhishma's sake. AndSalya struck Bhima with nine arrows, and Kritavarman struck him withthree, and Kripa with nine. And Chitrasena and Vikarna and Bhagadatta, Osire, each struck him with ten arrows. And the ruler of the Sindhusstruck him with three, and Vinda and Anuvinda of Avanti each struck himwith five arrows. And Duryodhana struck that son of Pandu with twentysharp arrows. Bhimasena, O king, pierced in return every one of thosekings, those foremost of men in the world, those mighty car-warriors ofthe Dhartarashtra army, one after another. The brave Pandava, that slayerof hostile heroes, pierced Salya with seven arrows, and Kritavarman witheight. And he cut off Kripa's bow with arrow fixed thereon, O Bharata, inthe middle, dividing it in twain. And after thus cutting off his bow, hepierced Kripa once more with seven arrows. And he struck Vinda andAnuvinda with three arrows each. And he pierced Durmarshana with twentyarrows, and Chitrasena with five, and Vikarna with ten, and Jayadrathawith five. And once more striking the ruler of the Sindhus with threearrows, he uttered a loud shout, filled with joy. Then Gautama, thatforemost of car-warriors, taking up another bow, angrily pierced Bhimawith ten sharp shafts. Pierced with those ten shafts like a huge elephantwith the hook, the valiant Bhimasena, O king, filled with wrath, struckGautama in that battle with many shafts. Possessed of the splendour ofYama himself, as he appears at the end of the Yuga, Bhimasena then, withthree arrows, despatched unto Death's domain the steeds of the ruler ofthe Sindhus as also his charioteer. Thereupon that mighty car-warrior,(viz., Jayadratha), quickly jumping down from that car whose steeds hadbeen slain, shot in that battle many sharp-pointed shafts at Bhimasena.Then, O sire, with a couple of broad-headed arrows, he cut off, O chiefof the Bharatas, the bow of the high-souled king of the Sindhus in themiddle. His bow cut off, himself deprived of car, his steeds andcharioteer slain, Jayadratha then, O king, quickly mounted on the car ofChitrasena. Indeed, the son of Pandu achieved in that battle a mostwonderful feat, for piercing all those mighty car-warriors and holdingthem in check, he deprived, O sire, the ruler of the Sindhus of his carin the very sight of all the army. Salya could not brook to see theprowess that Bhimasena displayed, for saying unto him,--Wait, Wait,--heaimed some sharp arrows well-polished by the forger's hands, and piercedBhima therewith in that battle. And Kripa and Kritavarman and the valiantBhagadatta, and Vinda and Anuvinda of Avanti, and Chitrasena, andDurmarshana, and Vikarna, and the valiant ruler of the Sindhus also, inthat battle,--These chastisers of foes, all quickly pierced Bhima for thesake of Salya. Bhima then pierced each of them in return with fivearrows. And he pierced Salya then with seventy arrows and once more withten. And Salya then pierced him with nine arrows and once more with five.And he pierced Bhimasena's charioteer also, deep in his vitals, with abroad-headed arrow. The valiant Bhimasena then, beholding his charioteerVisoka deeply pierced, sped three arrows at the arms and chest of theruler of Madras. And as regards the other great bowmen, he pierced eachof them in that battle With three straight arrows, and then uttered aloud roar like that of a lion. Each of those great bowmen then, exertinghimself with vigour, deeply Pierced that son of Pandu skilled in battle,with three arrows in his vitals. That mighty bowman viz., Bhimasena,though pierced deeply, trembled not (but stood still) like a mountaindrenched with torrents of rain by showering clouds. Then that mightycar-warrior of the Pandavas, filled with wrath, that celebrated hero,deeply, pierced the ruler of the Madras with three arrows. And he piercedthe ruler of the Pragjyotishas, O king, in that battle, with a hundredarrows. Of great renown, he then pierced Kripa with many arrows, andthen, displaying great dexterity, he cut off with a keen-edged shaft thebow, with arrow fixed thereon, of the high-souled Kritavarman. ThenKritavarman, that scorcher of foes, taking up another bow, struckVrikodara between his eyebrows with a long arrow. Bhima, however, in thatbattle, having pierced Salya with nine arrows made wholly of iron, andBhagadatta with three, and Kritavarman with eight, pierced each of theothers with Gautama at their head, with two arrows. Those warriors also,in return, pierced him, O king, with sharp-pointed shafts. Though thusafflicted by those mighty car-warriors with all kinds of weapons, yet,regarding them all as straw, he coursed on the field without any anxiety.Those foremost of car-warriors (on the other hand), with great coolness,sped at Bhima sharp-pointed arrows by hundreds and thousands. The heroicand mighty Bhagadatta then, in that battle, hurled at him a dart offierce impetuosity furnished with a golden staff. And the Sindhu king, ofstrong arms, hurled at him a lance and an axe. And Kripa, O king, hurledat him a Sataghni, and Salya an arrow. And the other great bowmen eachsped at him five arrows with great force. The son of the Wind-god thencut off, with a sharp shaft, that lance in twain. And he cut off that axealso with three shafts, as if it were a sesame stalk. And with fiveshafts winged with the feathers of the Kanka bird, he cut that Sataghniinto fragments. That mighty car-warrior then, having cut off the arrowsped by the ruler of the Madras, forcibly cut off the dart sped byBhagadatta in that battle. As regards the other fierce shafts, Bhimasena,proud of his feats in battle, cut them each into three fragments by meansof his own straight shafts. And he struck each of those great bowmen alsowith three shafts. Then Dhananjaya, during the progress of that dreadfulbattle, beholding the mighty car-warrior Bhima striking the foe andbattling (against many) with his arrows, came thither on his car. Thenthose bulls among men, of thy army, beholding those two high-souled sonsof Pandu together, gave up all hopes of victory. Then Arjuna, desirous ofslaying Bhishma, placing Sikhandin before him, approached Bhima who hadbeen fighting with those great car-warriors and fell upon those fiercecombatants, numbering ten, of thy army, O Bharata. Then Vibhatsu,desirous of doing what was agreeable to Bhima, pierced all thosewarriors, O king, who had been battling with Bhima. Then king Duryodhanaurged Susarman, for the destruction of both Arjuna and Bhimasena, saying,'O Susarman, go thou quickly supported by a large force. Slay those twosons of Pandu, viz., Dhananjaya and Vrikodara.' Hearing these words ofhis, the Trigarta king who ruled the country called Prasthala, quicklyrushed in battle upon those two bowmen, viz., Bhima and Dhananjaya, andsurrounded them both by many thousands of cars. Then commenced a fiercebattle between Arjuna and the foe.\"\n",

      " 74\"Sanjaya said, 'Hearing these words of Keshava, O Bharata, Vibhatsu sooncast off his anxiety and became cheerful. Rubbing then the string ofgandiva and stretching it, he held his bow for the destruction of Karna,and addressed Keshava, saying, 'With thee for my protector, O Govinda,and when thou that art acquainted with the past and the future artgratified with me today, victory is sure to be mine. Aided by thee, OKrishna, I can, in great battle, destroy the three worlds assembledtogether, what need be said of Karna then? I see the Pancala host isflying away, O Janardana. I see also Karna careering fearlessly inbattle. I see too the bhargava weapon careering in all directions, havingbeen invoked by Karna, O thou of Vrishni's race, like the puissantthunder invoked by Shakra. This is that battle in which Karna will beslain by me and of which all creatures will speak as long as the earthwill last. Today, O Krishna, unbarbed arrows, impelled by my arms andsped from the gandiva, mangling Karna, will take him to Yama. Today kingDhritarashtra will curse that intelligence of his in consequence of whichhe had installed Duryodhana, who was undeserving of sovereignty, on thethrone. Today, O mighty-armed one, Dhritarashtra will be divested ofsovereignty, happiness, prosperity, kingdom, city, and sons. I tell theetruly, O Krishna, that today, Karna being slain, Duryodhana will becomehopeless of both life and kingdom. Today, beholding Karna cut in piecesby me with my arrows, like Vritra in days of yore by Indra in the battlebetween the gods and the asuras, let king Duryodhana call to mind thewords thou hast spoken for bringing about peace. Today let the son ofSubala, O Krishna, know that my shafts are dice, my gandiva the box forthrowing them, and my car, the chequered cloth. O Govinda, slaying Karnawith keen shafts I will dispel the long sleeplessness of Kunti's son.Today the royal son of Kunti, upon the slaughter of the Suta's son by me,shall be gratified and be of cheerful heart and obtain happiness forever. Today, O Keshava, I will shoot an irresistible and unrivalled arrowthat will deprive Karna of life. Even this, O Krishna, was the vow ofthat wicked-souled one about my slaughter, viz., 'I will not wash my feettill I slay Phalguna.' Falsifying this vow of that wretch, O slayer ofMadhu, I will, with straight shafts, throw down his body today from hiscar. Today the earth will drink the blood of that Suta's son who inbattle condemns all other men on earth! With Dhritarashtra's approbation,the Suta's son Karna, boasting of his own merits, had said, 'Thou hast nohusband now, O Krishna!' My keen shafts will falsify that speech of his.Like angry snakes of virulent poison, they will drink his life-blood.Cloth-yard shafts, of the effulgence of the lightning, shot by myselfpossessed of mighty arms, sped from Gandiva, will send Karna on his lastjourney. Today the son of Radha will repent for those cruel words that hesaid unto the princess of Pancala in the midst of the assembly, indisparagement of the Pandavas! They that were on that occasion sesameseeds without kernel, will today become seeds with kernel after the fallof the Suta's son Karna of wicked soul, otherwise called Vaikartana! 'Iwill save ye from the sons of Pandu!'--even these were the words thatKarna, bragging of his own merits, said unto the sons of Dhritarashtra!My keen shafts will falsify that speech of his! Today, in the very sightof all the bowmen, I will slay that Karna who said, 'I will slay all thePancalas with their sons.' Today, O slayer of Madhu, I will slay thatKarna, that son of Radha, relying on whose prowess the proud son ofDhritarashtra, of wicked understanding, always disregarded us. Today, OKrishna, after Karna's fall, the Dhartarashtras with their king, struckwith panic, will fly away in all directions, like deer afraid of thelion. Today let king Duryodhana repent upon the slaughter of Karna, withhis sons and relatives, by me in battle. Today, beholding Karna slain,let the wrathful son of Dhritarashtra, O Krishna, know me to be theforemost of all bowmen in battle. Today, I will make king Dhritarashtra,with his sons and grandsons and counsellors and servants, shelterless.Today, cranes and other carnivorous birds will, O Keshava, sport over thelimbs of Karna cut off into pieces with my shafts. Today, O slayer ofMadhu, I will cut off in battle the head of Radha's son Karna, in thevery sight of all the bowmen. Today, O slayer of Madhu, I will cut off inbattle the limbs of Radha's son of wicked soul with keen vipathas andrazor-faced arrows. Today, the heroic king Yudhishthira will cast off agreat pain and a great sorrow cherished long in his heart. Today, OKeshava, slaying the son of Radha, with all his kinsmen, I will gladdenking Yudhishthira, the son of Dharma. Today, I will slay the cheerlessfollowers of Karna in battle, with shafts resembling the blazing fire orthe poison of the snake. Today, with my straight shafts equipped withvulturine feathers, I will, O Govinda, cause the earth to be strewn with(the bodies of) kings cased in golden armour. Today, O slayer of Madhu, Iwill, with keen shafts, crush the bodies and cut off the heads of all thefoes of Abhimanyu. Today, I will bestow the earth, divested ofDhartarashtras on my brother, or, perhaps, thou, O Keshava, wilt walkover the earth divested of Arjuna! Today, O Krishna, I will free myselffrom the debt I owe to all bowmen, to my own wrath, to the Kurus, to myshafts, and to gandiva. Today, I will be freed from the grief that I havecherished for thirteen years, O Krishna, by slaying Karna in battle likeMaghavat slaying Samvara. Today, after I have slain Karna in battle, letthe mighty car-warriors of the Somakas, who are desirous of accomplishingthe task of their allies, regard their task as accomplished. I do notknow what will be the measure, O Madhava, of the joy of Sini's grandsontoday after I shall have slain Karna and won the victory. Today, I willslay Karna in battle as also his son, that mighty car-warrior, and givejoy to Bhima and the twins and Satyaki. Today, slaying Karna in dreadfulbattle, I will pay off my debt, O Madhava, to the Pancalas withDhrishtadyumna and Shikhandi! Today let all behold the wrathfulDhananjaya fight with the Kauravas in battle and slay the Suta's son.Once more there is none equal to me in the world. In prowess also, who isthere that resembles me? What other man is there that is equal to me inforgiveness? In wrath also, there is no one that is equal to me. Armedwith the bow and aided by the prowess of my arms, I can vanquish theAsuras and the gods and all creatures united together. Know that myprowess is higher than the highest. Alone assailing all the Kurus and theBahlikas with the fire of my shafts issuing from Gandiva, I will, puttingforth my might, burn them with their followers like a fire in the midstof a heap of dry grass at the close of winter. My palms bear these marksof arrows and this excellent and outstretched bow with arrow fixed on thestring. On each of the soles of my feet occur the mark of a car and astandard. When a person like me goeth forth to battle, he cannot bevanquished by any one.\" Having said these words unto Acyuta, thatforemost of all heroes, that slayer of foes, with blood red eyes,proceeded quickly to battle, for rescuing Bhima and cutting off the headfrom Karna's trunk.'\"\n",

      " CCIII\"Sanjaya said, 'Having battled fiercely for five days, O king, theBrahmana (Drona) endued with great strength, fell and repaired to theregion of Brahma. The fruits that arise from a study of the Vedas arisefrom a study of this Parva also. The great achievements of braveKshatriyas have been described here. He who readeth or listeneth to therecitation of this Parva every day is freed from heinous sins and themost atrocious acts of his life. Brahmanas may always obtain herefrom thefruits of sacrifices. From this, Kshatriyas may obtain victory in fiercebattle. The other orders (Vaisyas and Sudras) may obtain desirable sonsand grandsons and all objects of desire!'\"The end of Drona Parva.FOOTNOTES1. Literally, like an oration teeming with unrefined expressions.2. i.e., deprived of robes and ornaments because of her widowhood.3. A Sarabha is a fabulous animal of eight legs supposed to be strongerthan the lion.4. The sense seems to be, that when such an one hath been slain, what isthere on earth that is not subject to destruction? Ye, should, therefore,grieve for your wealth, children etc. as things already gone.5. There is a slight difference of reading in this sloka as it occurs inthe Bombay text. The sense seems to be, that since everything is destinedto die, why should I fear to do my duty.6. The last line is read incorrectly, I think, in the Bombay text.7. The second fine of 12 is read incorrectly in the Bengal text. Insteadof tathapi the true reading (as in the Bombay edition) is tavapi.8. Kula-samhanana-jnana, i.e., 'knowledge of Kula, as also of samhanana,which latter, as Nilakantha explains, means the body. A knowledge of thebody, of vital and other limbs, was possessed by every accomplishedwarrior who wanted to smite effectually.9. i.e., who will feel it humiliating for him to walk behind Drona?10. A substantial difference of reading occurs here between the Bengaland the Bombay texts. Both have defects of their own. It seems to me thatDrona, as leader, proceeded in the van. Karna, when described asproceeding at the head of all bowmen, must be taken marching at the headof the whole rear guard. In the case, his position would be immediatelybehind Drona's.11. Lit, \"placed army to their right,\" i.e., these birds wheeled to theleft of thy host, which is an evil omen.12. The first line of 23 is read with a slight variation in the Bengaltext. The words 'nothing could be seen save Drona's arrows' are addedhere to make the sense clear.13. Probably, a ready instrument.14. The sense seems to be that having carefully attained Arjuna in armshe has got the fruit of his care and labour in the form of defeat anddeath at the hands of, or, at least, through, his own pupil.15. This sentence comprises 7. 8 and the first line of 9. I have followedthe exact order of the original. The peculiarity of the Sanskritconstruction is that the Nominative Pronoun is made to stand inapposition with a noun in the objective case. The whole of this Sectioncontains many such sentences.16. 10 and 11 also refer to Ajatasatru.17. Ghatotkacha was the son of Hidimva by Bhimasena. Rakshasi women bringforth the very day they conceive, and their offspring attain to youth thevery day they are born!18. Hayaraja, lit., the prince of steeds. He was an Asura, otherwisecalled Kesi, in the form of a steed.19. i.e., without weapons of any kind.20. Kaliprasanna Singha, in his Bengali translation, makes a mess of thisSloka.21. Jarasandha, the powerful king of the Magadhas, and the sworn foe ofKrishna, was slain by Bhima through Krishna's instigation.22. viz., the transplantation of the Parijata from Amaravati to the earth.23. Though gods, they have taken their births as men, and, they mustachieve their objects by human means. It is for this that they do not, bya fiat only of their will, destroy this host.24. The Bengal Texts read this verse incorrectly. For Prataptam, thecorrect reading is satatam; and for anukarinas, the correct word isasukarinas.25. The Bengal reading is Sura-vyala. The Bombay texts reads Sulav-yala.I adopt the latter. Vajinas, in Prani-vaji-nishevitam, is explained byNilakantha to mean fowl or bird.26. It is evident that the very minuteness with which the comparison issought to be sustained, destroys the effect. Regarding the repetition,they are just such as one may expect to find in verses composed extempore.27. This verse is read incorrectly in the Bengal texts. For hayan readDhanus.28. The word \"heroic\" occurs in the next verse.29. The word in the original are Sampata, Abhighata, and Nipata.30. Nishka, literally, a golden coin, whose weight is diversely stated bydiverse authorities.31. I adopt the Bengal reading which is Vidhayaivam. The Bombay readingis Vihayainam, meaning 'leaving Yudhishthira.'32. Soldiers sworn to conquer or die. Instead of using a long-windedphrase each time the word occurs, it is better to repeat it in this form.33. The second line reads differently in the Bombay text.34. It seems that the text here is vicious. It certainly requiressettling. One complete Sloka seems to be wanting.35. The second line of this verse is certainly vicious.36. Ekacharas is explained by Nilakantha as 'unable to bear the sight ofothers of their species,' i.e., walking by themselves, or solitarily orsingly. Some of the vernacular translators are for taking this word asimplying the Rhinoceros.37. Literally, 'thought in his mind that his hour was come.'38. Literally, half-moon-shaped.'39. Cruel because it was a Brahmana with whom Satanika was fighting.40. The Bengal reading Vahupellava is a mistake. The correct reading isVahupannaga as in the Bombay text.41. Using even these as implements for striking, for Bhima's might wassuperhuman.42. Hemadandais is a mistake of the Bengal texts for Hemabhandiers.43. The first line of 20 is vicious as it occurs in the Bengal texts. TheBombay reading is correct.44. 'This seems to be a repetition of the 6th verse.45. i.e., not to abandon their comrades in distress.46. The last word of the first line of 74 is vicious as printed in theBengal texts.47. The custom, when one warrior attacked another, was invariably to givehis name and lineage before striking.48. All the printed texts, not excepting that of Bombay, read Drupadeyas.There can be no doubt, however, that it should be Draupadeyas.49. The first line of 54 is read incorrectly in the Bengal texts. Ifollow the Bombay reading.50. After 19 occurs a complete sloka in the Bombay text which does notappear to be genuine.51. The second line of 46 is omitted in the Bengal texts.52. The Bengali translators have made a mess of these two verses. Amongothers, K. P. Singha makes Ruchiparvan follow Bhima and suppose Suvarchasto be some Pandava warrior who slew Ruchiparvan. The reading Suvarchas isvicious. The correct reading is Suparva, meaning, as Nilakantha explains,\"of beautiful limbs.\" Parvatapati is Bhagadatta himself.53. The Bengal reading abhitas is incorrect. It should be Kshubitas.54. I render 16 and 17 rather freely, as otherwise the sense would not beclear.55. The Bengal texts read,--\"he is either the first or the second, on theearth, I think.\"56. The Bombay reading paritas is vicious. The Bengal texts read twaritas.57. The Bengal texts read the second line differently. Lokam(accusative). For Gharmancubhis the Bengal reading is Gharmamvubhis.Nilakantha explains that varsha (whence varshika) means season. HenceNigadavarshikau masau would mean the two months of summer. If the Bengalreading were adopted, the meaning would be \"like summer and the rainyseasons afflicting the world with sweat and rain.\"58. The Bengal reading Samprapte is vicious. The Bombay readingSambhrante is evidently correct.59. I render 5 a little freely, and expand it slightly to make the senseclear.60. The Bengal reading Purvabhilashi is better than Purvabhilbhashi.Between Nila and Aswatthaman existed a rivalry since some time.61. The word in the original is dhumaketu. Elsewhere I have rendered itcomet. It would seem, however, that is wrong. In such passages the wordis used in its literal sense, viz., \"(an article) having smoke for itsmark,\" hence fire.62. The first half of the first line of 21 seems to be grammaticallyconnected with 20.63. The last half of the second line of 4 is vicious as occuring in theBengal texts. The correct reading is ayuduha-viarada.64. Janghas, etc., are diverse limbs of cars used in battle.65. 'The second half of the second line of 2 is vicious in the Bengaltexts.66. I omit the names as they occur in the text. These are: (1)Kshurupras, i.e., arrows sharp as razors, (2) Vatsadantas, i.e., arrowshaving heads like the calf-tooth, (3) Vipathas, i.e., long arrows havingstout bodies, (4) Narachas, long arrows; Ardhachandrabhais, i.e., lookinglike shafts furnished with heads of the form of the half-moon; it is anadjective qualifying Narachis, (5) Anjalikas were broad-headed shafts.67. There are the names of diverse kinds of drums small and large.68. I adopt the Bombay reading of the 1st line of 4.69. The fruit being the present encounter with Abhimanyu in whichDuhsasana, according to Abhimanyu, shall have to lay down his life.70. Pravanddiva is explained by Nilakantha as nimnadeeam prapya. Themeaning seems to be, as I have put it, \"like an elephant in a low land,i.e., land covered with mud and water.\"71. These words occur in 17 lower down.72. 'These are limbs of cars.73. The Bombay reading is slightly different.74. Literally, \"like another son of the Lord of Treasure\".75. I confess I do not understand what the meaning is of asiva vachvzSrijatam. The rendering I offer is tentative.76. I follow the numbering of the Bengal texts. 23 consists of threelines.77. I expand the 5th a little to make the sense clear.78. I expand the 5th a little to make the sense clear.79. In the first fine of 3, the correct reading is Karnanchapy akarotkradha, etc., the reading in the Bengal text is vicious and unmeaning.80. Bengal text read Taru-tringani i.e., tree-tops.81. The correct reading is Mahavalan Mahavalat.82. The Bombay reading which I accept, is Valabudhischa. Of course Bengalreading is Avalabudhischa.83. During the days of mourning a person is regarded as unclean, beingunable to perform his ordinary worship and other religious rites. Afterthe obsequies are performed the mourning is ended, he is supposed to becleansed.84. The first line of 6 is read differently in the Bombay edition. TheBengal reading, however, seems to me to be preferable.85. Both the Bengal and Bombay editions, in the first line of 12, readprita, i.e., gratified. There can be no doubt, however, that the correctreading is Bhita, i.e., affrighted, as I have put it. I find that some ofthe Bengali translators have also made this correction.86. Devas, in the first line of 46, means the senses, Vrittas, asexplained by Nilakantha, means Vritavantus.87. Verse 55, as occuring in both the Bengal and the Bombay text,requires corrections, 55 is incomplete. For the words tada Raja,therefore, I read Sokam tyaja, as suggested by K. P. Singha. Then theVisarga after Yudhishthira must be dropped to make it a vocative.Similarly, Pandavas in 58 should be Pandava, a vocative and not anominative upakramat should be upakrama. The last two corrections aremade in the Bombay text. The fact, is, are 55 to 58 the words of Vyasa,or of Sanjaya? Evidently, it is Vyasa that speaks, and, hence thenecessity of the corrections noted.88. I follow Nilakantha in rendering these two verses.89. Of golden excreta.90. The Bengal reading is Samvartam. The Bombay text makes Samvarta anominative. I have adopted the Bengal reading. If the Bombay reading beaccepted, the meaning would be that Samvarta himself, piqued withVrihaspati, caused Marutta to perform a sacrifice. K. P. Singha makes aludicrous blunder in supposing Samvarta to have been a kind of sacrifice.91. The word in the original Atavika, literally meaning one dwelling inthe woods. It is very generally used in the sense of thieves or robbers,thus showing that these depredators from the earliest times, had thewoods and the forests for their home.92. Vahinyas rivers. Swairinyas, open to every body. The Bengal readingis abhavan; the Bombay reading Vyatahan. If the former reading be,adopted, it would mean the rivers were of liquid gold.93. i.e., sacrifices ordained for Kshatriyas.94. Siksha, one of the six branches of Vedas; it may be called theorthoepy of the Vedas. Akshara, letters of the alphabet. The sense seemsto be that these Brahmanas were good readers of the Vedas.95. The word in the original Murddhabhishikta, which literally means onewhose coronal locks have undergone the ceremony of the sacredinvestiture. Hence, it is used to denote Kshatriyas or persons of theroyal order.96. Havisha mudamavahat; or havisham udam avahat, which would mean, hepoured libations unto Indra as copious as water.97. Because juniors pre-deceased their seniors. The causative form ofakarayan is a license.98. The four kinds of creatures that owned Rama's sway were (1) thosethat were oviparous, (2) those that were viviparous, (3) those born offilth, and (4) the vegetables.99. These were ghats for facilitating access to the sacred stream.100. Both 5 and 6 are difficult slokas. But for Nilakantha I could neverhave understood their sense. The reading Jalaughena, occuring in both theBengal and the Bombay editions, is a mistake for Janaughena. Theconstruction of 5 is this: Dakshina Bhuyasirdadat: tena hetuna Janaughenaakaranta. The story of the salvation of Bhagiratha's ancestors is abeautiful myth. King Sagara (whence Sagara or the Ocean) had sixtythousand sons. They were all reduced to ashes by the curse of the sageKapila, an incarnation of Vishnu himself. Bhagiratha, a remotedescendant, caused the sacred Ganga to roll over the spot where the ashesof his ancestors lay, and thus procured their salvation.101. The correct reading is Valguvadinas, and not the form in thegenitive plural.102. In the Bombay edition some verses occur after the 3rd.103. Literally \"Having me for his sustainer.\"104. Instead of Suna, the Bombay text gives Puru.105. The Bengal text reads this verse differently.106. The words in italics are names of Indian confectionery, preparedwith wheat or barley, milk, and sugar or honey.107. These are the methods by which he sought knowledge of the Vedas.108. 'Nakshatra-dakshina is explained by Nilakantha as Nakshatravihitro-Dakshina.109. The Bengal reading of the second line of the second verse isvicious. At any rate, the Bombay reading is better.110. Animals slain in sacrifices are believed to go to heaven.111. Identified with the modern Chumbal.112. A kind of vessel used by Brahmanas and others for begging.113. Vaswoksara means made 'of gold.' It is a feminine adjective. Thesubstantive is omitted. I think the passage may mean--'The city ofRantideva is made of gold.'114. A Vyama is the space between the two arms extended at their furthest.115. Literally, a Kshatriya is one that rescues another from wounds andinjuries.116. A raja is one who enjoys the affection of his people, and with whomthey are delighted.117. The bow of Siva, otherwise called Pinaka.118. Aklishtakarman, literally, one who is never fatigued with work;hence one capable of obtaining the results of action by a mere fiat ofthe will. It may also mean, of unspotted acts.119. Parthivas, i.e., relating to the earth.120. The first line of the verse, I think, has been correctly explainedby Nilakantha. The paraphrase is ya imam bhumim sukham kurvan adyam i.e.adyam yugam anuparyeti sma.121. The Bombay text adds some verses here which do not occur in theBengal texts.122. K. P. Sinha makes a ludicrous blunder in reading this line.123. Sannahikas, i.e., clad in mail.124. The Bengal reading Dwijaidhitam is certainly better than the Bombayreading Dwijochitam although Nilakantha explains uchitam as abhimatam.125. Twilight is herself the goddess who is supposed to be adored bycertain prayers and on the occasion.126. These slaps mark the cadences.127. Literally, 'in crossing.'128. The Bengal reading Satyavrataiv in the first line of 9 is vicious. Iadopt the Bombay reading Satyaratas, qualifying tara. To suppose thatKrishna paid such a complement to the Kauravas as is implied by theBengal reading is an absurdity.129. i.e. added his voice to that of Jayadratha, requesting Drona toprotect the latter.130. A kind of car or vehicle.131. Nilakantha supposes that tasmai here refers to the Three-eyed andnot to Krishna. This seems to be right.132. The second note of the Hindu gamut.133. Vasavamiva is a mistake for Vasavasyeva.134. Apavrittam is explained by Nilakantha as endangered or madedoubtful. What Sanjaya says is that if it is not so, thou shalt then haveto undergo the bitterness of ruling over the whole world bestowed uponthee by the Pandavas. Either the Pandavas will snatch away thy kingdom ormake thee ruler of the whole after slaying thy sons. Either of thesealternatives would be bitter to thee.135. The original is pleonastic.136. This verse obviously needs correction. Instead of \"golden coats ofmail,\" I think some such correction is needed, viz. coats of mail, ofblack iron, decked with gold and dyed with blood, etc.137. The original is pleonastic.138. This Sloka occurs in all the texts. It would seem, therefore, thatSanjaya was not always a witness only of the battle for narrating what hesaw to Dhritarashtra, but sometimes at least he took part in the battle.139. The words tatsainyanyabhyapujayan seem to be unmeaning in thisconnection. The Bengali translators, unable to do anything with them,have left them out.140. The celestial weapons were forces dependent on mantras. Ordinaryshafts, inspired with these mantras, were converted into celestialweapons.141. In other words. Arjuna's car shot as quickly through the enemy asthe arrows themselves sped from it.142. The Bengal reading of the first line is vicious. The Bombay readingis Vamatkum Vipathum, Vanan. The first word means the froth in the mouthof the steeds.143. i.e., his funeral obsequies. The vernacular translators do not seethe intended joke.144. I give the sense of this verse, without giving a closely literalversion.145. Avabhritha is the final bath undergone, on completion of assacrifice by the person performing the sacrifice. The slaughter ofDuryodhana would according to Krishna, be the avabhritha of the sacrificeof battle.146. Praviddham means fallen down or loosened from its usual place. ThusNilakantha.147. Tripura means the three cities constructed by the Asura artificerMaya. The Asura, however, who owned those cities is also called Tripura.It was Mahadeva who destroyed the three cities with all their populationvide the close of the Harivansa.148. The true reading is alohita and not lohita. Arka here is crystal andnot the sun. It was a silvern boar, which could not, evidently, be likethe sun.149. Owners of golden cars.150. Nidas were niches or drivers boxes.151. Many of the opening slokas of this section are nearly the same asthose of section 76 of Bhishma Parva, vide ante. In a few instances Ihave adopted the readings of the Bombay edition.152. I prefer the reading Samakulam to Jhashakulam.153. i.e., using cars and elephants as weapons for destroying cars andelephants.154. The fear behind them was from the Pandava army. The fear before themwas from the car-warriors who had succeeded in penetrating the Kuru host.155. Many of the Bengal texts have Calabhairiva. This is a mistake, theword being Calada, and not Calabha which would be unmeaning here.156. I render the second line of 4 too freely. The sense seems to be thatwhen two persons fight, one cannot say beforehand who will succeed. Bothhave chances of success, as, indeed, both have chances of defeat.157. The genius of the two languages being entirely different, I give thesense of the first line of 14 separately, without seeking to connect it,in the assertive form, with the second half of 13.158. Literally, 'disregard of Krishna.'159. The Bombay reading, which I adopt, seems to be better than theBengal one.160. I think that both Vrikodaram and nisitais in this verse as given inthe Bombay text are incorrect. I read Vrikodaras and navavhis followingthe Bengal texts.161. The sense seems to be that Karna and Bhima were like fire and wind.162. Verse 28 is a triplet. The second line is obscure. It seems that aline has been omitted.163. Literally, mustered all his rage.164. In the first line of the 62 the Bengal reading Ayastam is betterthan the Bombay reading Ayastas.165. Literally, 'a mountain overgrown with medicinal herbs of greatefficacy.' Of course, the allusion is to Hanumat's removal ofGandhamadana for the cure of Lakshmana.166. i.e., the little indent caused by a cow's hoof.167. The sense is that he that will slay me will always be victorious inbattle, will always slay the warriors with whom he may be engaged inbattle. Defeat will never be his.168. do not render 55 literally. Satyaki is called 'Satyavikrama,' i.e.,of true prowess' or 'of prowess incapable of being baffled.' If hesustains a defeat today at Bhurisrava's hand, that title of his will befalsified. This is all that Krishna means.169. Verse 20 is incomplete. I supply the words,--'Why then should I notprotect' in order to make the meaning intelligible. The first line of 21is grammatically connected with 20. To avoid an ugly construction Irender it separately.170. Literally, 'who could witness with indifference Satyaki reduced tothat plight?'171. Generally, to die, abstaining from all food. It is a method offreeing the soul from the body by Yoga.172. Literally, 'near the place assigned for the sacrificial butter.'173. Nilakantha explains chakram as Pratapam.174. The second line of 94 I render a little freely to make the senseclearer.175. A Kavandha is a headless trunk moving about as if endued with life.Tales are told of these headless beings drinking the blood of victimsfalling within their grasp.176. The second of the seven notes of the Hindu gamut.177. The printed editions and the manuscripts do not agree with oneanother in respect of the order and numbering of the last dozen verses.The Bombay edition omits a few of the verses.178. Everything even the inanimate creation, exists and adores theSupreme deity.179. This is a triplet in the Calcutta edition.180. Literally, 'the fact of the Dhartarashtras having sunk (intodistress).'181. Literally, 'of persons whose coronal locks have undergone the sacredbath.'182. Praluvdhas is explained by Nilakantha differently. He supposes thatDuryodhana here characterises Sikhandin to be a deceitful fowler orhunter in consequence of the deceit with which he caused Bhishma's fall.This is far-fetched.183. I adopt the Bombay reading.184. The Bombay edition reads this verse differently and introducesanother after it which does not occur in the Bengal texts.185. I am not sure whether I have rendered the 31st and the first half of32nd correctly. The vernacular translators have made a mess of thepassage. The difficulty lies with Surhittamais. I take it to mean thatDuryodhana says, 'Karna, Sakuni, Duhsasana, with myself, had taken thee,O preceptor, for a friend, and had engaged thee in this battle. We didnot, however, then know that thou art an enemy in disguise.'186. i.e., 'he should, by very means in his power, avenge himself on theSomakas, those enemies of mine.'187. This is a triplet in the Bengal texts.188. I render the second line freely, following Nilakantha.189. Literally, 'with shafts resembling his rays.'190. Or, 'as a lake overgrown with lotuses is agitated on every side byan elephant.'191. Sixteen lines, occurring after this in the Bombay edition, have beenomitted in the Calcutta edition.192. Drums of diverse kinds and sizes.193. The Bombay reading is apalavam and not viplatam.194. This is a triplet in all the editions.195. The brother of the Kalinga prince.196. Patanipam is explained by Nilakantha as something that causes thepatana or downfall of a person hence sin. [There is no reference for thisnote in the body of this page, so I have placed it in a likelylocation.--JBH]197. A nalwa measured four hundred cubits.198. Nilakantha explains that there were Pisachas.199. Aswatthaman and the Pandavas were like brothers, for both weredisciples of Drona Ghatotkacha, therefore, having been Bhima's son wasAswatthaman's brother's son.200. i.e., the weapon endued with the force of the thunder.201. Different species of Rakshasas.202. Tripura, belonging to an Asura of the same.203. Asani literally means the thunder. Probably, some kind of iron mace.204. The Bengal texts read Utkrisha-vikramas. The correct reading seemsto be Aklivhtavikramas. Then again Sahanujam seems to be inaccurate. Ifollow the Bombay reading Sahanugam.205. Achyuta, when used as a proper noun, refers to Krishna. It means ofunfading glory and 'the immortal.'206. Sight differences are observable between the Bengal and the Bombaytexts as regards the last three verses.207. This is a triplet.208. This is a triplet.209. In the second line of 4, utsedha and not udvrita is the truereading. So also kanchit and not kinchit. The paraphrase, according toNilakantha, in kanchit dhanurdharam na ganayan, etc.210. 147 is a triplet.211. The Bengal reading sudakshinas at the end of 49 dose not seem to becorrect. I adopt the Bombay reading sudarnnam.212. The Bombay edition reads the first line of 3 differently. The Bengalreading is also defective. The correct reading seems to be Rathanagainstead of Naranaga.213. This is a Triplet.214. Instead of mattagaje, the Bombay edition reads tatragaje.215. There seems to be a mistake in this sloka in its reference to thePandavas. The reading, however, that occurs in all the printed edition,is the same. In one manuscript I find Kamrava-yodhavurgais (which Iadopt) for Pandava-Kauraveyais.216. The second line of 30, as it occurs in the Bengal texts, is adoptedby me. A slight difference of reading occurs between the Bengal and theBombay editions.217. As regards almost every one of these slokas, differences of readingare observable between the Bengal texts and the Bombay edition. Thereadings of the Bombay edition are almost uniformly better. Then, again,many of those verses are disfigured with syntactical pleonasms and othergrave errors. Abounding with tiresome repetitions that scarcely attractnotice amid the variety of synonyms with which the language of theoriginal abounds and amid also the melodious flow of the rhythm, thedefects become glaring in translation. At the latter, however, offaithfulness, I have been obliged to sacrifice elegance, in renderingthis section.218. The Bengal reading tatha loka is incorrect. The Bombay textcorrectly reads tadaloka. Then also, instead of the Bengal readingrajasacaa samavrite (which is faulty), the true reading is raja tamasavrite.219. Lokanamabhave is explained by Nilakantha as pralaya-kale.220. A different reading occurs in the Bombay edition.221. Nalikas, as used here, appear to have been some species of shafts.In an earlier note, relying on other authorities, I took it to mean somekind of air-gun.222. Vaikartana may also mean one who has peeled off his skin of naturalarmour. To preserve dramatic propriety, the Hindu commentators explain itin this sense when it occurs in any such passage, for the real origin ofKarna, viz., his procreation by the deity of the sun, became known afterhis death.223. 'The second line of 9 is read differently in the Calcutta edition. Iadopt the Bombay reading.224. In the second line of 13, Avyayatturnam instead of Maharaja is thecorrect reading.225. This sloka seems to be a vicious one.226. Yena and tena here are equal to yatra and tatra.227. In the first line of 30 Vaganais and not Vanaganan is the truereading.228. The second line of 30 is read differently in the Calcutta edition.In consequence also of some differences between two printed editions, 30of the Calcutta text is 32 of the Bombay text.229. In the Bengal texts this is a triplet.230. It is for this that I see thee with this head as a tribute.231. An arani is a cubit measuring from the elbow to the end of thelittle figure.232. Both reading, viz., asaktam and asaktam are correct. The formermeans engaged' the latter, 'to the measure of his might!'233. The second line of 85 is differently in the Bombay edition.234. Rakshasas at certain hours were believed to be inspired with greaterstrength.235. Mainaka the son of Himavat, has a hundred heads.236. i.e., they thought they obtained a new lease of life.237. Literally means, \"united by Jara.\"238. Nilakantha thinks that Sagadaya in one word, meaning 'deprived ofthe both Rakshasas and the mace.' This is far-fetched.239. Fire being the mouth of the celestials, without fire, the celestialsbecome mouthless. Thus Nilakantha.240. This is a triplet in the Bengal texts.241. 66 is a triplet in the Bengal texts.242. Triyama, literally, consisting of three Yamas, a Yama being a watchof three hours. The first hour and a half of the night and the last hourand a half, being regarded as twilight, the night, truly as such, withthe ancient Hindoos, consisted of only nine hours.243. Literally, 'of a thousand Yamas.'244. The moon is called the lord of lilies because the water-lily is seento bloom at moonrise, just as the sun is called the lord of the lotusesbecause the lotus blooms at sun-rise, The direction presided over byIndra means the East.245. Dasatakasha-kkupa means the Kakup or direction presided by him of athousand eyes; hence the East.246. Instead of Vrishodara, the Bombay text reads Vrishottama, which Iadopt.247. In the first line of 31, the Bengal texts read Rajanam probablyreferring to Drupada. The correct reading, however, is Rujendra in thevocative case as in the Bombay edition.248. I render this a little too freely. The form of the oath is, \"Letthat man lose, etc. whom Drona escapes today with life or whom Dronavanquishes today.\"249. This, in the Bengal texts, is a triplet.250. I adopt the Bombay reading of the first line of this verse.251. All these arrows inflicted had wounds and could not be easilyextracted. Shafts of crooked courses were condemned because thecombatants could not easily baffle them, not knowing at whom they wouldfall.252. This verse is omitted in the Bombay text. There can be no doubt,however, about its genuineness.253. The celestial weapons were all living agents that appeared at thebidding of him who knew to invoke them. They abandoned, however, theperson whose death was imminent, although invoked with the usual formulae.254. I adopt the Bombay reading.255. Deprived of both the worlds, having sustained a defeat, they lostthis world, and flying away from the field, they committed a sin and lostthe next world.256. Celestial weapons were invoked with mantras, as explained in aprevious note. They were forces which created all sorts of tangibleweapons that the invoked desired. Here the Brahma weapon took the form ofbroad-headed arrows.257. Dharmadhwajin literally means a person bearing the standard ofvirtue, hence, hypocrite, sanctimoniously talking only virtue andmorality but acting differently.258. I think the correct reading is aputrinas and not putrinas. If it isputrinas, literally rendered, the meaning is, 'Why should persons havingchildren, feel any affection for the latter?' It the worthy of remarkthat the author of Venisamhara has bodily adopted this verse, putting itin the mouth of Aswatthaman when introduced in the third Act.259. The last line of 37 is read differently in the Bombay edition.Nilakantha accepts that reading, and explains it in his gloss remarkingthat the grammatical solecism occuring in it is a license. The Bengalreading, however, is more apposite.260. Literally, \"the animals kept the Pandavas to their right.\"261. Dasaratha's son Rama, during his exile, slew the monkey-chief Bali,the brother of Sugriva, while Bali was engaged with Sugriva in battle.Bali had not done any injury to Rama. That act has always been regardedas a stain on Rama.262. I expand the original to make the sense clear.263. The first line of the 23rd verse in the Bengal editions, is made thesecond line of that verse in the Bombay text. There seems to be amistake, however, in both the texts. Vishnu slew Hiranyakasipu withoutallowing, the latter to say anything unto him. Vide Vishnu Purana, ifinstead of Hiranyakasipu Harim, the rendering be Hiranyakasipu Haris, theline may then be connected with Bhima's speech, and the comparison wouldbecome more apposite.264. The Nishadas were and to this day are the lowest caste in India.265. The Bengal reading is vicious, I adopt the Bombay reading which isSurorgurunsha bhuyopi, meaning, \"this preceptor again.\" The fact is,Arjuna was Satyaki's preceptor; Drona, therefore, was the latter'spreceptor's preceptor.266. Kimpurushas were fabled creatures, half men and steeds. Not amountain but had its Kimpurushas, according to the Hindu belief. Yakshaswere a sort of superhuman beings inhabiting inaccessible halls andmountains.267. I adopt the Bombay reading of the 2nd line of 35 and think thatNilakantha explains it correctly.268. I adopt the Bombay reading.269. Nilakantha explains this to mean that when he became unconnectedwith the world, rising superior to everything connected with the world.270. The terrible.271. Amritasya yonim, literally, the origin or cause of immortality,i.e., he from whom immortality springs. Hence, as explained byNilakantha, the phrase means the source of salvation, for those only thatare emancipate became immortal as the Supreme Soul itself.272. i.e., the five attributes perceivable by the five senses, with thefive objects of Nature with which they are directly connected or in whichthey manifest themselves.273. Having given it away to Rama, his disciple.274. All these terms imply Death or the Destroyer\n",
