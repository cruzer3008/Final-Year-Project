# Final-Year-Project

Notebooks of interest are:-

In the main directory - For mahabharata:
1. Words_csv_generator generates a csv file consisting every word and attributes related to it
2. Network_Relation_Generator_For_Any_Character.ipynb generates the relation of a character with other characters
3. WordCloud_For_Any_Character.ipynb generates word cloud describing the specified character

In the directory Pride and Prejudice - We tried the similar thing on an english novel:
1. Book_Split_AND_Words_csv_Generator.ipynb generates words.csv.
2. Character List Generator.ipynb - we tried to make a list of characters in the book
3. Word cloud - Similar to what was done above
Also the relation of a character to other characters can be generated for this book as done above (That file hasn't been written yet.)
