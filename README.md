# Final-Year-Project

Notebooks of interest are:-

In the Mahabharata directory:
1. Words_csv_generator.ipynb generates a csv file consisting every word and attributes related to it. The file generated cannot be pushed to github since it exceeds 100 MB and thus will not be visible as of now.
2. Network_Relation_Generator_For_Any_Character.ipynb generates the relation of a character with other characters
3. WordCloud_For_Any_Character.ipynb generates word cloud describing the specified character.

In the directory Pride and Prejudice - We tried the similar thing on an english novel:
1. Book_Split_AND_Words_csv_Generator.ipynb generates words.csv. The file generated cannot be pushed to github since it exceeds 100 MB and thus will not be visible as of now.
2. Character List Generator.ipynb - We tried to make a list of characters in the book.
3. Word cloud - Similar to what was done in the above case with mahabharata.

Also the relation of a character to other characters can be generated for this book as done above (That file hasn't been written yet.)
